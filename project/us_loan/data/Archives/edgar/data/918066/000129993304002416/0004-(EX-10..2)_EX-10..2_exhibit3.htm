<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">In the event of any conflict between any Fundamental Lease Provision and the balance of this
Lease, the latter shall control.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">3.&nbsp;<U>AGREEMENT TO LEASE</U>. Landlord hereby leases to Tenant, and Tenant hereby leases
from Landlord, the Premises, under the terms and conditions of this Lease.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 12pt">4. <U>TERM AND POSSESSION</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">4.1 <U>Lease Term</U>. The initial Lease Term shall begin as of the Lease Commencement Date
and shall continue until fifteen (15)&nbsp;years after the Lease Commencement Date unless sooner
terminated or renewed as provided in this Lease. Landlord and Tenant shall execute a written
acknowledgment of the Lease Commencement Date and the termination date in substantially the form
attached hereto as Exhibit &#147;C&#148;; however, failure to execute and deliver such acknowledgment shall
not affect Tenant&#146;s liability hereunder. Provided that no Default has occurred and is continuing
at the time Tenant elects to extend the Lease Term, Tenant, at its sole option, may extend the
Lease Term for two (2)&nbsp;additional periods of ten (10)&nbsp;years each (individually, an &#147;<U>Extension
Period</U>&#148;), subject to all the provisions of this Lease, <U>except</U>, <U>however</U> the Rent
(as defined in Paragraph&nbsp;5 below) shall be adjusted at the commencement of each Extension Period to
an amount equal to the then current fair market rental rate as agreed to by Landlord and Tenant,
<U>but in no event</U> shall the Rent be less than the Rent payable on the date immediately
preceding the commencement of such Extension Period, plus an escalation of three percent (3%) as
provided in Paragraph&nbsp;5.1.4 below. If after thirty (30)&nbsp;days following delivery of the written
extension notice described in Paragraph&nbsp;4.2 below, Landlord and Tenant are unable to agree upon the
fair market rental value of the Premises, Tenant shall obtain at its expense and deliver to
Landlord an independent appraisal of the fair market rental value of the Premises as of the
commencement of the Extension Period. Within thirty (30)&nbsp;days of its receipt of Tenant&#146;s
appraisal, Landlord may elect to obtain at its expense and deliver to Tenant a second independent
appraisal of the fair market rental value of the Premises as of the commencement of the Extension
Period. If Landlord elects not to obtain and deliver to Tenant a second appraisal within the
required time period, or if Landlord&#146;s appraisal is no more than five percent (5%) greater than
Tenant&#146;s appraisal, Tenant&#146;s appraisal shall be conclusive. If Landlord&#146;s appraisal is more than
five percent (5%) greater than Tenant&#146;s appraisal, the two appraisers shall appoint a third
appraiser to appraise the fair market rental value of the Premises as of the commencement of the
Extension Period, and the fair market rental value of the Premises shall be the arithmetical
average of the two appraisals closest in their determination of fair market rental value. Landlord
and Tenant shall bear equally the expense of the third appraiser. The Monthly Rent as so
determined for each Extension Period shall be increased annually by three percent (3%) as provided
in Paragraph&nbsp;5.1.4 below. All references in this Lease to &#147;<U>Lease Term</U>&#148; shall be considered
to include both the initial term of this Lease and any properly executed Extension Period, and all
references to termination or to the end of the Lease Term shall be considered to mean the
termination or end of the initial term of this Lease or any exercised Extension Period, as the case
may be.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">4.2 <U>Procedure to Extend Term</U>. Tenant may exercise its option with respect to each
Extension Period by complying with the following procedure: At least eighteen (18)&nbsp;months before
the last day of the then applicable Lease Term (the &#147;<U>Exercise Period</U>&#148;), Tenant shall
deliver written notice to Landlord setting forth Tenant&#146;s irrevocable election to exercise the
option to extend. Extension Periods are not assignable separate and apart from this Lease, but
they may be assigned as part of an assignment of this Lease.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">4.3 <U>Tenant&#146;s Default</U>. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Default has occurred and is
continuing at the time Tenant elects to extend the Lease Term, Tenant shall have no right to extend
the Lease Term as herein provided unless and until Tenant cures such Default, and Landlord shall be
free to lease the Premises to any other party or parties prior thereto. Furthermore, nothing in
this Paragraph&nbsp;4.3 shall increase or extend the Exercise Period.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">4.4 <U>Possession</U>. Tenant hereby acknowledges that it is presently in possession of the
Premises as prior owner of the Premises.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 12pt">5. <U>RENT; SECURITY DEPOSIT</U>.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:8%; font-size: 12pt">5.1 <U>Monthly Rent</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">5.1.1 Tenant shall pay the Rent to Landlord during the Lease Term, commencing as of the Lease
Commencement Date, without deduction, setoff, prior notice or demand. Tenant shall pay the Rent in
advance on the first day of each calendar month during the Lease Term. Rent for any partial months
will be prorated based upon the number of days in the month, and will be paid in advance on the
first day of each month.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">5.1.2 Upon the Lease Commencement Date, Tenant shall pay to Landlord the Rent due and payable
for the first full calendar month of the Lease Term. If the Lease Commencement Date is not on the
first day of a calendar month, Tenant shall pay to Landlord the prorated Rent for the first partial
month of the Lease Term.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">5.1.3 All Rent payable hereunder shall be paid to Landlord in lawful money of the United
States of America which shall be legal tender at the time of payment at Landlord&#146;s office or to
such other person or at such other place as Landlord from time to time may designate in writing.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">5.1.4 The Initial Annual Rent shall be the amount set forth in Paragraph&nbsp;2. The Annual Rent
will be payable in twelve (12)&nbsp;equal installments (&#147;<U>Monthly Rent</U>&#148;). Effective upon the
first (1<sup>st</sup>) anniversary date of the Lease Commencement Date and each year thereafter
during the Lease Term (including any Extension Period), on the anniversary of the Lease
Commencement Date, the Monthly Rent during such year shall be increased by three percent (3%) of
its then current amount.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">5.2 <U>Additional Rent</U>. Commencing upon the Lease Commencement Date Tenant shall pay to
Landlord (unless otherwise expressly required hereunder to pay directly to a third party), as
additional rent (&#147;<U>Additional Rent</U>&#148;), all sums of money of any and every sort required to be
paid by Tenant under this Lease, whether or not the same are designated as Additional Rent. If
such amounts or charges are not paid at the time provided in this Lease, they shall nevertheless be
collectible as Additional Rent with the next installment of Monthly Rent thereafter falling due,
but nothing herein contained shall be deemed to suspend or delay the payment of any amount of money
or charge at the time the same becomes due and payable hereunder, or limit any other remedy of
Landlord. Tenant acknowledges that this is an absolute net lease to Landlord. As such, Tenant
shall pay, as Additional Rent, all costs and expenses relating to the Premises.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">5.3 <U>Late Payment</U>. If Tenant shall fail to pay, when the same is due and payable
(after giving effect to any applicable notice and cure period), any Rent, such unpaid amounts shall
bear interest at the Default Rate from the date due to the date of payment. Tenant further
acknowledges that late payment of Monthly Rent will cause Landlord to incur certain costs not
contemplated by this Lease, the exact amount of such costs being extremely difficult and
impractical to determine with certainty. For this reason, in addition to interest, if Tenant shall
fail to pay (which for purposes of this paragraph, &#147;pay&#148; shall mean actual receipt of the payment
by Landlord) any installment of Monthly Rent by the tenth (10<sup>th</sup>) day of the calendar
month for which such installment is due, a late charge equal to five percent (5%) of the overdue
installment of Monthly Rent automatically shall be due without further notice, and shall be in
addition to all other sums due. The Parties agree that this additional late charge represents a
fair and reasonable estimate of the costs Landlord will incur by reason of late payment by Tenant.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">5.4 <U>No Right to Setoff</U>. Tenant shall pay to Landlord, throughout the Lease Term, the
Rent and other sums payable hereunder, free of any charges, assessments, deductions or reductions
of any kind, and without abatement, deduction or setoff except as otherwise expressly provided for
herein.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">5.5 <U>Payment of Security Deposit</U>. Upon the Lease Commencement Date, Tenant shall
deposit the Security Deposit with Landlord. The Security Deposit shall be deposited by Landlord
into a nonsegregated, interest-bearing bank account (with interest accruing for the benefit of
Landlord) in a federally insured bank or savings institution, and shall be held for the faithful
performance of all of the provisions and conditions of this Lease to be kept and performed by
Tenant hereunder. If at any time Tenant shall have reported in its periodic filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission three (3)&nbsp;consecutive calendar quarters of positive net income,
the Security Deposit shall be reduced by fifty percent (50%).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">5.6 <U>Use of Security Deposit</U>. If a Default occurs with respect to the payment of Rent
or any other covenant contained herein, Landlord may use or retain all or any part of the Security
Deposit for the payment of any Monthly Rent, Additional Rent or any other sum in default, or for
the payment of any amount which Landlord may spend or become obligated to spend by reason of
Tenant&#146;s Default. Landlord also may apply the Security Deposit toward costs incurred to repair
damages to the Premises or to clean the Premises upon termination of this Lease. If any portion of
the Security Deposit is so applied or used prior to the termination of this Lease, Tenant shall,
within fourteen (14)&nbsp;days after written notice thereof, deposit an additional amount with Landlord
sufficient to restore the Security Deposit to the amount set forth above, and Tenant&#146;s failure to
do so shall constitute a material breach of this Lease. If Tenant shall fully and faithfully
perform every provision of this Lease to be performed by Tenant, the Security Deposit (including
interest thereon), or the balance thereof, shall be returned to Tenant (or, at Landlord&#146;s option to
the last assignee of Tenant&#146;s interest hereunder) at the expiration of the Lease, subject to the
provisions of Paragraph&nbsp;27.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">5.7 <U>Pledge of Security Deposit</U>. The Security Deposit may be pledged by Landlord as
additional collateral to the Lender.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">5.8 <U>Letter of Credit</U>. The Security Deposit may be delivered either in cash or in the
form of letter of credit reasonably acceptable to Landlord.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">5.8.1 In lieu of depositing cash as the Security Deposit, Tenant shall have the right to
deliver to Landlord an unconditional, irrevocable standby letter of credit in the amount of the
cash Security Deposit otherwise required hereunder, which letter of credit shall (i)&nbsp;be in a form
reasonably acceptable to Landlord, (ii)&nbsp;be issued by a financial institution selected by Tenant and
reasonably acceptable to Landlord, (iii)&nbsp;be for the benefit of Landlord, but shall be assignable by
Landlord to any subsequent purchaser or encumbrancer of the Building or the Premises, (iv)&nbsp;be
automatically renewable from year to year throughout the Lease Term, (v)&nbsp;be payable by draft sight
in a location reasonably acceptable to Landlord upon presentation of a certification signed by an
officer of Landlord which states that a Default under the Lease has occurred and has not been cured
within any applicable cure period and the cure of the Default is not being diligently pursued, and
(vi)&nbsp;be payable in the event such letter of credit is not renewed on or before the date which is
thirty (30)&nbsp;days prior to its expiration. Any amounts of cash drawn on a letter of credit Security
Deposit will thereafter be treated as a cash Security Deposit hereunder.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">5.8.2 Tenant shall have the right at any time during the Lease Term upon five (5)&nbsp;days&#146; prior

occupation thereof.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">6.3 <U>Exterior Appearance</U>. Except as may be in existence on the Effective Date or as

<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 12pt">7. <U>OPERATING EXPENSES</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">7.1 <U>Payment of Real Property Taxes</U>. Commencing with the Lease Commencement Date and
continuing for each calendar year, or tax year at Landlord&#146;s option (such &#147;tax year&#148; being a period
of twelve (12)&nbsp;consecutive calendar months for which the applicable taxing authority levies or
assesses Taxes), for the balance of the Lease Term, Tenant shall pay to Landlord the amount of all
Taxes levied and assessed for any such year upon the Premises. Such sum for any partial year of
the Lease Term shall be prorated on the basis of the number of days of such partial year. Payment
shall be made in the following manner: Tenant shall pay to Landlord the amount of all Taxes levied
and assessed upon the Premises, including improvements and the underlying realty for any calendar
year, or at Landlord&#146;s option any tax year, within thirty (30)&nbsp;days after Landlord gives notice to
Tenant of the amount of such Taxes payable by Tenant (or not less than thirty (30)&nbsp;days prior to
delinquency, whichever is later). Landlord also shall provide Tenant with a copy of the applicable
Tax bill or Tax statement from the taxing authority. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if applicable
law allows such Taxes to be paid in installments, then Tenant may make such payments to Landlord in
installments, provided that each such installment shall be payable to Landlord not less than thirty
(30)&nbsp;days prior to the date upon which payment of the applicable installment to the taxing
authority becomes delinquent. In addition to any other amounts due from Tenant to Landlord, if
Tenant fails to pay the Taxes to Landlord as herein required, Tenant shall pay to Landlord the
amount of any interest, penalties or late charges imposed for late payment. Landlord, at its
option, may require Tenant to pay all Taxes directly to the appropriate taxing authority under the
same manner and subject to the provisions set forth in this Paragraph&nbsp;7.1 (as if the governmental
authority were &#147;Landlord&#148;). Tenant shall provide to Landlord verification (reasonably acceptable
to Landlord) of said payment within five (5)&nbsp;days of payment.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">7.1.1 If the Premises are separately assessed, Tenant shall have the right, by appropriate
proceedings, to protest or contest in good faith any assessment or reassessment of Taxes, any
special assessment, or the validity of any Taxes or of any change in assessment or tax rate;
provided, however, that prior to any such challenge Tenant must either (a)&nbsp;pay the taxes alleged to
be due in their entirety and seek a refund from the appropriate authority, or (b)&nbsp;post bond in an
amount sufficient to insure full payment of the Taxes. In any event, upon a final determination
with respect to such contest or protest, Tenant shall promptly pay all sums found to be due with
respect thereto. In any such protest or contest, Tenant may act in its own name, and at the
request of Tenant, Landlord shall cooperate with Tenant in any way Tenant may reasonably require in
connection with such contest or protest, including signing such documents as Tenant reasonably
shall request, provided that such cooperation shall be at no expense to Landlord and shall not
require Landlord to attend any appeal or other hearing. Any such contest or protest shall be at
Tenant&#146;s sole expense, and if any penalties, interest or late charges become payable with respect
to the Taxes as a result of such contest or protest, Tenant shall pay the same.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">7.1.2 If Tenant obtains a refund as the result of Tenant&#146;s protest or contest and subject to
Tenant&#146;s obligation to pay Landlord&#146;s costs (if any) associated therewith, Tenant shall be entitled
to such refund to the extent it relates to the Premises during the Lease Term.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">7.2 <U>Personal Property Taxes</U>. Tenant shall be solely responsible for the payment of
any and all taxes levied upon personal property and trade fixtures located upon the Premises.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">7.3 <U>Other Taxes</U>. If at any time during the Lease Term under the laws of the United
States Government, state, county or city, or any political subdivision thereof in which the
Premises are situated, a tax or excise on rent or any other tax, however described, is levied or
assessed by any such political body against Landlord on account of rentals payable to Landlord
hereunder, such tax or excise shall be considered &#147;Taxes&#148; for the purposes of this Paragraph&nbsp;7,
excluding, however, from such tax or excise any amount assessed against Landlord as state or
federal income tax.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">7.4 <U>Tax and Insurance Escrows</U>. To the extent Landlord is required by Lender, Tenant
shall timely pay all tax and insurance impound payments due on the Premises.

and maintenance of the Building and the Premises including, by way of examples and not as a
limitation upon the generality of the foregoing, costs of repairs and replacements to improvements
within the Premises as appropriate to maintain the Premises as required hereunder, including cost

parking areas, including without limitation, janitors, floor waxers, window-washers, watchmen,
gardeners, sweepers and handymen; and costs of management services, which costs of management
services shall not exceed three percent (3%) of the Rent due from Tenant, whether or not Landlord
incurs fees payable to any third party to provide such services and without regard to the actual
costs incurred by Landlord for such services.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 15%">(c)&nbsp;Notwithstanding the foregoing, Operating Expenses shall not include any leasing
commissions; expenses which relate to preparation of rental space for a tenant; expenses of initial
development and construction, including but not limited to, grading, paving, landscaping and
decorating (as distinguished from maintenance repair and replacement of the foregoing); legal
expenses relating to other tenants; costs of repair to the extent reimbursed by payment received by
Landlord of insurance or other proceeds; interest upon loans to Landlord or secured by mortgage or
deed of trust covering the Premises or a portion thereof (provided interest upon a government
assessment or improvement bond payable in installments is an Operating Expense under subparagraph
(a)&nbsp;above); salaries of executive officers of Landlord or other employees of Landlord who are not
involved in the operation, maintenance or repair of the Premises; depreciation claimed by Landlord
for tax purposes (provided this exclusion of &#147;depreciation&#148; is not intended to delete from
Operating Expenses actual costs of necessary repairs and replacements and reasonable reserves in
regard thereto which are provided for in subparagraph (b)&nbsp;above); and taxes of the types set forth
within the last proviso of Paragraph&nbsp;1.12 above.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">7.5.2 Tenant shall pay to Landlord on the first day of each calendar month of the Term, as
Additional Rent, Landlord&#146;s reasonable estimate of Operating Expenses with respect to the Premises
for such month. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at the election of Landlord, Tenant shall pay all
or certain Operating Expenses (as designated in writing by Landlord) directly to the appropriate
vendor, service provider or governmental authority.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 15%">(a)&nbsp;Within ninety (90)&nbsp;days after the conclusion of each calendar year (or such longer period
as may be reasonably required), Landlord shall furnish to Tenant a statement showing in reasonable
detail the actual Operating Expenses for the previous calendar year. Any additional sum due from
Tenant to Landlord shall be immediately due and payable. If the amounts paid by Tenant pursuant to
Paragraph&nbsp;7.5.2 exceed Operating Expenses for the previous calendar year, the difference shall be
credited by Landlord against the Rent next due and owing from Tenant; provided that, if the Lease
Term has expired, Landlord shall accompany said statement with payment for the amount of such
difference.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 15%">(b)&nbsp;Any amount due under this Paragraph&nbsp;7.5.2 for any period which is less than a full month
shall be prorated (based on a 30-day month) for such fractional month.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">7.5.3 Landlord&#146;s annual statement shall be final and binding upon Tenant unless Tenant, within
thirty (30)&nbsp;days after Tenant&#146;s receipt thereof, shall contest any item therein by giving written
notice to Landlord, specifying each item contested and the reason therefor. If, during such thirty
(30)&nbsp;day period, Tenant reasonably and in good faith questions or contests the correctness of
Landlord&#146;s statement of Operating Expenses, Landlord will provide Tenant with access to Landlord&#146;s
books and records and such information as Landlord reasonably determines to be responsive to
Tenant&#146;s questions and shall allow Tenant a reasonable amount of time to review such records and
information. In the event that after Tenant&#146;s review of such information, Landlord and Tenant
cannot agree upon the amount of Operating Expenses, then Tenant shall have the right to have an
independent public accounting firm hired by Tenant (at Tenant&#146;s sole cost and expense unless the
audit discloses a discrepancy of five percent (5%) or greater of the amount of Operating Expenses
set forth in Landlord&#146;s statement of Operating Expenses, in which case Landlord shall pay for the
reasonable costs of such audit) and approved by Landlord (which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) audit and/or review such information and books and records for the year in
question (the &#147;<U>Independent Review</U>&#148;). The results of any such Independent Review shall be
binding on Landlord and Tenant. If the Independent Review shows that Operating Expenses actually
paid for the calendar year in question exceeded Tenant&#146;s obligations for such calendar year,
Landlord shall, at Tenant&#146;s option, either (1)&nbsp;credit the excess to the next succeeding
installments of estimated Additional Rent or (2)&nbsp;pay the excess to Tenant within thirty (30)&nbsp;days
after delivery of such statement. If the Independent Review shows that Tenant&#146;s payments of
Operating Expenses for such calendar year were less than Tenant&#146;s obligation for the calendar year,
Tenant shall pay the deficiency to the Landlord within thirty (30)&nbsp;days after delivery of such
statement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">7.5.4 Tenant acknowledges and agrees that Tenant, as owner and/or lessee of the Premises
immediately prior to the execution of this Lease, is solely responsible for the payment of all
Taxes, utility charges, insurance premiums, maintenance costs and any other Operating Expense due
and payable and pertaining to the Premises prior to the Lease Commencement Date (the &#147;<U>Prior
Expenses</U>&#148;). Tenant shall indemnify and hold harmless Landlord from and against all Claims
arising out of or related to the Prior Expenses. The responsibility of Tenant for Operating
Expenses shall continue to the latest of (i)&nbsp;the date of termination of the Lease, (ii)&nbsp;the date
Tenant has fully vacated the Premises, or (iii)&nbsp;if termination of the Lease is due to the Default
of Tenant, the earlier of the date of rental commencement of a replacement tenant or the date a
replacement tenant takes possession of the Premises.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">7.5.5 Operating Expenses for the calendar year in which Tenant&#146;s obligation to share therein
commences and in the calendar year in which such obligation ceases, shall be prorated on a basis
reasonably determined by Landlord. Expenses such as taxes, assessments and insurance premiums
which are incurred for an extended time period shall be prorated based upon time periods to which
applicable so that the amounts attributed to the Premises relate in a reasonable manner to the time
period wherein Tenant has an obligation to share in Operating Expenses.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 12pt">8. <U>CONDITION OF PREMISES</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">8.1 <U>Condition of Premises</U>. Tenant has determined to lease the Premises after a full
and complete investigation and examination thereof. Tenant accepts the Premises and all other
rights under this Lease &#147;as is.&#148; Except as is expressly provided herein, Landlord shall not be
required to furnish any services or facilities or to make any repairs or alterations in or to the
Premises throughout the Lease Term. Tenant acknowledges that Tenant is the prior owner of the
Premises and as such is fully aware of the current condition of the Premises.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">8.2 <U>No Warranties</U>. Landlord has not made and makes no representations or warranties
to Tenant of any kind regarding the Premises or the Building, including, without limitation, any
representation or warranty regarding the physical condition of the Premises, its suitability for
Tenant&#146;s intended use, or the availability or capacity of utilities or sewer to the Premises.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 12pt">9. <U>ALTERATIONS AND IMPROVEMENTS</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">9.1 <U>Construction Requirements</U>. Any alterations or improvements to the Premises of any
kind by Tenant the cost of which exceeds One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) or which
materially alters, affects, or modifies Building systems (including, without limitation,
mechanical, electrical, plumbing, or HVAC systems), structural components, or the exterior of the
Building shall be subject to satisfaction of each of the following conditions:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">9.1.1 <U>Architectural Review</U>. Prior to commencement of any work, Tenant shall submit
its proposed final plans and specifications to Landlord for Landlord&#146;s consent, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. Landlord agrees to respond to Tenant&#146;s
proposed final plans and specifications within fifteen (15)&nbsp;days after its receipt of such final
plans and specifications. Landlord&#146;s failure to approve or disapprove within said fifteen (15)
days shall be deemed approval.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">9.1.2 <U>Code Compliance</U>. Tenant shall comply with all Applicable Law, and Tenant shall
obtain all required permits and approvals, including, but not limited to, any grading permits,
building permits, zoning and planning requirements and approvals from any and all necessary
governmental agencies and bodies.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">9.1.3 <U>Insurance</U>. Tenant shall deliver to Landlord certificates of insurance
evidencing that Tenant or the general contractor has obtained builder&#146;s all-risk risk insurance in
an amount not less than Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000). Tenant also shall deliver to Landlord
evidence of worker&#146;s compensation insurance coverage for all persons employed in connection with
the construction and with respect to whom death or personal injury claims could be asserted against
Landlord or the Premises. Tenant also shall deliver to Landlord evidence that Tenant has paid or
caused to be paid all premiums for the insurance described in this paragraph. Tenant shall
maintain or cause to be paid all premiums required to maintain and keep in force all insurance
described in this paragraph at all times during which the construction is in progress.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">9.1.4 <U>Construction Requirements</U>. Once any work of construction has begun, Tenant
shall prosecute with reasonable diligence the same to conclusion. All construction shall be
performed in a good and workmanlike manner, shall comply with all Applicable Law and shall be
completed in conformance with the plans and specifications approved by Landlord.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">9.1.5 <U>Notice of Construction; Mechanics&#146; Liens</U>. Landlord and its representatives
shall have the right to go upon and inspect the Premises at all reasonable times upon reasonable
prior notice and when accompanied by a representative of Tenant, and shall have the right to post
and keep posted thereon notices of non-responsibility, or such other notices that Landlord may deem
to be proper for the protection of Landlord&#146;s interest in the Premises; provided, however, that
such rights shall not unreasonably interfere with Tenant&#146;s use or possession of the Premises,
Landlord and Landlord&#146;s invitees shall abide by Tenant&#146;s safety practices and, except for true
emergencies in which the health or safety of persons are in immediate danger, when necessary to
save the destruction of significant property or when Landlord has provided reasonable prior notice
(including the timing and scope) of an inspection by a prospective purchaser, investor, lender or
insurer of the Premises, Landlord and Landlord&#146;s invitees shall not under any circumstances have
access to areas with confidential or proprietary information related to Tenant&#146;s business. Before
the commencement of any work, which might result in any lien, Tenant shall give to Landlord written
notice of its intention to do so in sufficient time to enable the posting of such notices. Subject
to Tenant&#146;s right to contest any Claim or lien, Tenant shall keep the Premises and the Building
free and clear of any and all liens and encumbrances which may arise at any time in connection with
the improvement of the Premises by Tenant or its agents and contractors. Subject to Tenant&#146;s right
to contest any Claim or lien, Tenant shall pay and discharge all expenses incurred by Tenant for
the services of mechanics and for the cost of goods and materials supplied by materialmen, and
Tenant shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Landlord and the Premises from and against any
Claims by such mechanics or materialmen for labor or services performed or goods supplied at the
request of Tenant. Furthermore, subject to Tenant&#146;s right to contest any Claim or lien, Tenant
shall, at its cost and expense, remove all such mechanics&#146; liens by bond or otherwise within ten
(10)&nbsp;working days after the filing thereof. If Tenant desires to contest any Claim or lien, it
shall be entitled to do so on the condition that Tenant first shall either (1)&nbsp;furnish Landlord a
bond of a responsible corporate surety approved by Landlord in such amount as is sufficient to
cause discharge of the lien of record, and conditioned on the discharge of the lien, or (2)&nbsp;furnish
Landlord with other assurances satisfactory to Landlord that Landlord will be protected from the
effect of such Claim or lien. If a final judgment establishing the validity or existence of a lien
for any amount is entered, Tenant shall pay and satisfy the same at once. If Tenant shall not have
paid, as and when required by this Paragraph&nbsp;9.1.5, any charge for which a mechanics&#146; lien claim
and suit to foreclose the lien have been filed, or if Tenant shall not have given Landlord security
to protect the Premises and Landlord against such Claim or lien as required by this Paragraph
9.1.5, Landlord, upon five (5)&nbsp;days notice to Tenant, may (but shall not be required to) pay said
lien or Claim including any costs, in which event the amount so paid, together with reasonable
attorneys&#146; fees incurred in connection therewith, shall be immediately due and owing from Tenant to
Landlord. Tenant shall pay the same to Landlord together with interest on the full amount thereof
at the Default Rate from the date of Landlord&#146;s payment until paid. If any Claims or liens are
filed against the Premises or, if any action affecting title to the Premises is commenced, the
party receiving notice of such lien or action shall forthwith give the other party written notice
thereof.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:12%; font-size: 12pt">9.1.6 <U>INTENTIONALLY OMITTED</U>.

notice of all changes in plans or specifications made during the course of the work and, at the
same time and in the same manner, shall supply Landlord with &#147;as built&#148; drawings accurately
reflecting all such changes.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">9.1.8 <U>Ownership of Improvements</U>. All improvements and fixtures existing on the
Premises and the Building including (without limiting the generality of the foregoing) all
wallcoverings, carpeting, flooring, built-in cabinet work, paneling and the like, all electrical,
mechanical, and plumbing equipment and related ducts, shafts, and conduits, all exterior venting
fume hoods, walk-in freezers and refrigerators, clean-rooms, climatized rooms, electrical panels
and power back-up distribution systems, other than those items of personal property that are leased
by Tenant, shall be the property of Landlord and shall remain upon, and be surrendered with the
Premises, as a part thereof, at the end of the Lease Term. In the event that Tenant desires to
make any alterations, additions or improvements governed by this Paragraph&nbsp;9.1 upon the Premises
during the Lease Term, Tenant shall submit to Landlord proposed final plans therefor, together with
a request (the &#147;<U>Identification Notice</U>&#148;) that Landlord identify to Tenant in writing which
of the proposed alterations, additions or improvements Landlord elects to remain property of Tenant
to be removed by Tenant at the end of the Lease Term (each a &#147;<U>Tenant-Owned Alteration</U>&#148;).
If Landlord fails to respond in writing to the Identification Notice (or fails to designate in
writing a proposed alteration, addition or improvement as a Tenant-Owned Alteration) within fifteen
(15)&nbsp;days after Landlord&#146;s receipt of the Identification Notice, then Landlord shall be deemed to
have elected to have any proposed alteration, addition or improvement not expressly designated as a

fail to remove all of its effects from the Premises upon termination of this Lease for any cause
whatsoever, Landlord, at its option, upon written notification to Tenant, may remove the same in
any manner that Landlord shall choose and store said effects without liability to Tenant for loss
thereof. In such event, Tenant agrees to pay Landlord upon demand any and all expenses incurred in
such removal, including court costs and reasonable attorneys&#146; fees and storage charges on such
effects, for any length of time that the same shall be in Landlord&#146;s possession. If Tenant shall

its option, without notice, may sell said effects, or any of the same, at private sale and without
legal process, for such price as Landlord may obtain and apply the proceeds of such sale upon the

ninety (90)&nbsp;days thereafter, Tenant shall commence repair, reconstruction and restoration of the
Premises and prosecute the same diligently to completion at Tenant&#146;s sole cost and expense whether
or not the insurance proceeds shall be sufficient for the purpose, and Landlord shall make
available to Tenant any insurance proceeds for such repair, reconstruction or restoration paid out
to Landlord by the insurer. This Lease shall continue in full force and effect, and Tenant&#146;s duty
to rebuild shall exist without regard to whether the damage or destruction is covered by insurance.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">17.1.2 Notwithstanding Paragraph&nbsp;17.1.1 hereof, in the event of a total destruction of the
Premises during the last two (2)&nbsp;years of the Lease Term, or the last year with respect to any
Extension Period, as the case may be, Landlord and Tenant each shall have the option to terminate
this Lease upon giving written notice to the other of exercise thereof within thirty (30)&nbsp;days
after such destruction, in which case this Lease shall cease and terminate as of the date of
destruction, and provided that, in the event of such termination by either Landlord or Tenant,
Tenant shall pay to Landlord the fair market value of the Premises less the fair market value of
the Land (to the extent such amount exceeds Landlord&#146;s insurance proceeds received from the
destruction). For purposes of this Paragraph&nbsp;17.1.2, &#147;total destruction&#148; shall be deemed a damage
or destruction to an extent that the cost of repair is at least fifty percent (50%) of the then
full replacement cost of the Premises as of the date of destruction.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">17.2 <U>Reconstruction</U>. In the event of any reconstruction of the Premises pursuant to
this Paragraph&nbsp;17, the construction by Tenant shall be subject to, and conducted in accordance
with, the provisions of Paragraph&nbsp;9 above.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">17.3 <U>Termination</U>. In the event of termination pursuant to this Paragraph&nbsp;17, all
right to compromise, adjust or settle any insurance claim shall be in Landlord, and all proceeds
from Tenant&#146;s insurance shall be disbursed and paid to, and be the property of, Landlord, except to
the extent such proceeds are allocable to the equipment, fixtures or other personal property of
Tenant.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">17.4 <U>No Abatement</U>. In the event of repair, reconstruction or restoration as herein
provided, the Monthly Rent, which Tenant is required to pay to Landlord under this Lease, shall not
be abated. Tenant shall continue the operation of its business on the Premises during any such
period to the extent reasonably practicable from the standpoint of prudent business management, and
the obligation hereunder to pay Additional Rent shall remain in full force and effect. Tenant
shall not be entitled to any compensation or damages from Landlord for loss of the use of the whole
or any part of the Premises, Tenant&#146;s personal property or any inconvenience or annoyance
occasioned by such damage, repair, reconstruction or restoration. Tenant hereby waives any
statutory or common law rights of termination or abatement of rent, which may arise by reason of
any partial or total destruction of the Premises.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 12pt">18. <U>ASSIGNMENT AND SUBLETTING</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">18.1 <U>No Assignment</U>. Tenant shall neither voluntarily nor by operation of law assign,
sell, encumber, pledge or otherwise transfer all or any part of Tenant&#146;s leasehold estate
hereunder, or permit any other person (excepting Tenant&#146;s agents and employees) to occupy the
Premises or any portion thereof, without Landlord&#146;s prior written consent, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Consent by Landlord to one or more assignments
of this Lease or to one or more sublettings of the Premises shall not constitute a waiver of
Landlord&#146;s right to require consent to any subsequent assignment, subletting or other transfer. If
Tenant is a corporation, unincorporated association or partnership, the transfer, assignment or
hypothecation of any stock or interest in such corporation, association or partnership in the
aggregate in excess of twenty-five percent (25%) of all outstanding stock or interests, or
liquidation thereof, shall be deemed an assignment within the meaning and provisions of this
paragraph; provided, however, the transfer, assignment or hypothecation of any stock in a
corporation or partnership which is a reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended, shall not be deemed an assignment within the meaning and provisions of this paragraph.
The sale of all or substantially all of the assets of Tenant, or the assignment of the Lease to an
entity into which Tenant is merged or with which Tenant is consolidated, shall be deemed an
assignment within the meanings and provisions of this paragraph, unless the successor entity has a
net worth equal to or greater than Tenant&#146;s net worth immediately prior to the transfer. Tenant
shall reimburse Landlord for all of Landlord&#146;s reasonable costs and attorneys&#146; fees incurred in
conjunction with the processing and documentation of any required consent to assignment,
subletting, transfer, change of ownership or hypothecation of this Lease or Tenant&#146;s interest in
and to the Premises. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant shall have the right, without the
consent of Landlord, to assign its rights and obligations pursuant to this Lease to a parent,
subsidiary or affiliate, provided that Tenant remains obligated under the Lease. For purposes of
this Paragraph, the term &#147;subsidiary&#148; shall mean and refer to any subsidiary of Tenant in which
Tenant owns fifty percent (50%) or more of the voting stock of such subsidiary. For purposes of
this Paragraph, the term &#147;affiliate&#148; shall mean and refer to any entity in which Tenant or parent
of Tenant owns fifty percent (50%) or more of the voting stock or ownership interest of such
entity.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">18.2 <U>Consent Required</U>. Landlord&#146;s consent to any assignment, sale, encumbrance,
pledge or other transfer shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. It shall not
be unreasonable for Landlord to base its determination as to whether consent will be granted in any
specific instance on, without limitation, the following factors: (a)&nbsp;whether the transferee&#146;s use
of the Premises will be compatible with the provisions of this Lease; (b)&nbsp;the financial capacity of
the transferee; (c)&nbsp;the business reputation of the transferee; (d)&nbsp;the quality and type of the
business operations of the transferee; and (e)&nbsp;the business experience of the proposed transferee.
This list of factors is not intended to be exclusive, and Landlord may rely on such other
reasonable basis for judgment as may apply from time to time.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">18.3 <U>Procedure to Obtain Consent</U>. If Tenant desires at any time to assign this Lease
or to sublet the Premises or any portions thereof, it first shall notify Landlord of its desire to
do so and shall submit in writing to Landlord (i)&nbsp;the name and legal composition of the proposed
subtenant or assignee; (ii)&nbsp;the nature of the proposed subtenant&#146;s or assignee&#146;s business to be
carried on in the Premises; (iii)&nbsp;the terms and provisions of the proposed sublease or assignment
and all transfer documents relating to the proposed transfer; and (iv)&nbsp;such reasonable business and
financial information as Landlord may request concerning the proposed subtenant or assignee. Any
request for Landlord&#146;s approval of a sublease or assignment shall be accompanied with a check in
the amount of $2,000.00 for the cost of review and preparation, including reasonable attorneys&#146;
fees, of any documents relating to such proposed transfer. Landlord shall notify Tenant of its
approval or disapproval of any such request within ten (10)&nbsp;business days of receipt of the
foregoing information and payment. Landlord&#146;s failure to respond within such ten (10)&nbsp;business day
period shall be deemed approval by Landlord. The provisions and conditions of any proposed
sublease or assignment must not be inconsistent with any provision of this Lease, and must address
all matters contained in this Lease. In addition, the transferee must expressly assume all of the
obligations of Tenant under this Lease. Notwithstanding the assumption of the obligations of this
Lease by the transferee, no subletting or assignment, even with the consent of Landlord, shall
relieve Tenant of its continuing obligation to pay the rent and perform all the other obligations
to be performed by Tenant hereunder. The obligations and liability of Tenant hereunder shall
continue notwithstanding the fact that Landlord may accept rent and other performance from the
transferee. The acceptance of rent by Landlord from any other person shall not be deemed to be a
waiver by Landlord of any provision of this Lease or to be a consent to any assignment or
subletting.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">18.4 <U>Advertising</U>. In no event shall Tenant display on or about the Premises any signs
for the purpose of advertising the Premises for assignment, subletting or other transfer of rights,
without Landlord&#146;s prior written consent.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">18.5 <U>Writing Required</U>. Each permitted assignment or sublease shall be consummated by
an instrument in writing executed by the transferor and transferee in form satisfactory to
Landlord. Each assignee and subtenant shall agree in writing for the benefit of the Landlord
herein to assume all obligations of Tenant hereunder, including the payment of all amounts due or
to become due under this Lease directly to the Landlord. One executed copy of such written
instrument shall be delivered to the Landlord.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">18.6 <U>Transfer Premiums</U>. If Tenant assigns or sublets its rights under this Lease,
Tenant shall pay to Landlord as Additional Rent, after Tenant has recovered any relevant leasing
commissions, costs of tenant improvements and other expenses of the assignment or sublease, fifty
percent (50%) of such excess consideration due and payable to Tenant from said assignment or
sublease to the extent said consideration exceeds the Rent or a pro rata portion of the Rent, in
the event only a portion of the Premises is sublet.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">19.&nbsp;<U>NO ENCUMBRANCE</U>. Without Landlord&#146;s prior written consent, Tenant shall not
mortgage, encumber or hypothecate its interest in this Lease, the Premises or the Building, and any
attempt by Tenant to do so shall be a default hereunder, and at Landlord&#146;s option, shall terminate
this Lease.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 12pt">20. <U>HAZARDOUS MATERIALS</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">20.1 <U>Hazardous Materials</U>. Tenant shall not use, store, dispose of or permit to remain
on the Premises, the Building, the Land, or any adjacent property other than in the normal course
of its business and in compliance with all applicable laws, any solid, liquid or gaseous matter or
any combination thereof, which is or may become, hazardous, toxic or radioactive including, but not
limited to, any substance, gas, or waste, which is included in the definition of &#147;hazardous
substance,&#148; &#147;toxic substance,&#148; &#147;hazardous waste,&#148; or &#147;toxic waste&#148; under any federal, state, or
local law, ordinance, or regulation, including any material which, if discharged, leaked or emitted
or permitted to be discharged, leaked or emitted into the atmosphere, the ground or any body of
water, does or may (i)&nbsp;pollute or contaminate the same, or (ii)&nbsp;adversely affect (A)&nbsp;the health or
safety of persons, whether on the Premises or anywhere else, (B)&nbsp;the condition, use or enjoyment of
the Premises or anywhere else, or (C)&nbsp;the Premises, the Building or any of the improvements thereon
(all of the foregoing collectively referred to herein as &#147;<U>Hazardous Materials</U>&#148;).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">20.2 <U>Testing</U>. At reasonable times and upon reasonable prior notice, prior to the
expiration or earlier termination of the Lease Term, Landlord shall have the right to conduct (a)
hazardous material and waste investigation(s) of the Premises and (b)&nbsp;if Landlord has reasonable
cause to believe that any contamination exists on, in, under, or around the Building or the
Premises, such other tests of the Premises and the Building as Landlord may deem necessary or
desirable to demonstrate whether contamination has occurred as a result of Tenant&#146;s use of the
Premises. Tenant shall be solely responsible for and shall defend, indemnify and hold the
Landlord, its Agents and contractors harmless from and against any and all Claims, arising out of
or in connection with any removal, clean up, restoration and materials required hereunder to return
the Premises and any other property of whatever nature to their condition existing prior to the
time of any such contamination, except for Claims caused by Landlord&#146;s or its Agents&#146; gross
negligence or willful misconduct. Tenant shall pay for the reasonable cost of the investigations
and other tests of the Premises.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">20.3 <U>Duty to Dispose</U>. Tenant shall not keep any trash, garbage, waste or other refuse
on the Premises except in sanitary containers and shall regularly and frequently remove the same
from the Premises. Tenant shall keep all incinerators, containers or other equipment used for the
storage or disposal of such matter in a clean and sanitary condition. Tenant shall properly
dispose of all sanitary sewage and shall not use the sewage disposal system of the Building (i)&nbsp;for
the disposal of anything except sanitary sewage, or (ii)&nbsp;for disposal of sewage in excess of the
lesser of the amount (A)&nbsp;reasonably contemplated by the uses permitted under this Lease, or (B)
permitted by any governmental entity.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">20.4 <U>Hazardous Materials Laws</U>. Tenant, at Tenant&#146;s own cost and expense, shall comply
with all existing and any hereinafter enacted federal, state or local laws pertaining to or
governing Hazardous Materials laws. Tenant, at Tenant&#146;s own cost and expense, shall make all
submissions to, provide all information to and comply with all applicable requirements of any
appropriate governmental authority (&#147;<U>Authority</U>&#148;) under all federal, state or local laws
pertaining to or governing Hazardous Materials. In particular, Tenant shall comply with all laws
relating to the storage, use and disposal of Hazardous Materials. Should any Authority require
that a clean up or remediation plan be prepared or that a clean up or any other remediation action
be undertaken because of any spills or discharges of Hazardous Materials at the Premises or on the
Premises or any adjacent property that occur during the Lease Term or after expiration of the Lease
Term as a result of Tenant&#146;s use of the Premises, then Tenant, at Tenant&#146;s own expense, shall
prepare and submit the required plans and financial assurances and carry out the approved plans.
At no expense to Landlord, Tenant promptly shall provide all information requested by Landlord for
preparation of affidavits required by Landlord or for Landlord&#146;s own information, to determine the
applicability of the Hazardous Materials laws to the Premises and shall execute affidavits promptly
when requested to so by Landlord.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">20.5 <U>Tenant Indemnification</U>. Tenant shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless
Landlord and Landlord&#146;s Agents from and against (i)&nbsp;Claims in connection with or arising out of any
release, spill or discharge of Hazardous Materials due to, contributed to or caused by the
activities of Tenant, Tenant&#146;s Agents, third parties who have trespassed on the Premises during the
Lease Term or parties in contractual relationship with Tenant or any of them; and (ii)&nbsp;all Claims
arising out of Tenant&#146;s failure to provide all information, make all submissions and take all steps
required by any Authority, under any federal, state or local laws pertaining to or governing
Hazardous Materials laws or any other environmental law. Tenant&#146;s obligations and liabilities
under this paragraph shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease. Without
limiting the foregoing, if the release, spill, leakage, or discharge of any Hazardous Materials on
or in the Premises or the Building or any adjacent property, caused or permitted by Tenant results
in any contamination of the Premises or the Building or any adjacent property, Tenant shall
promptly take all actions at its sole expense as are necessary to return the Premises or the
Building or any adjacent property, to the condition existing prior to the time of such
contamination, provided that Landlord&#146;s approval of such action shall first be obtained, which
approval shall not unreasonably be withheld, delayed or conditioned so long as such actions would
not potentially have any material adverse long-term or short-term effect on the Premises or the
Building. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnification herein shall not apply to the initial
introduction of Hazardous Materials on or to the Premises by anyone other than the Tenant from and
after the date that Tenant is neither the &#147;Tenant&#148; hereunder nor in possession of the Premises
(&#147;<U>Tenant Relinquishment Date</U>&#148;).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">20.6 <U>Obligation to Remediate Upon Expiration of Lease</U>. Tenant shall surrender the
Premises at the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease free of any Hazardous Materials or
contamination and free and clear of all judgments, liens, licenses, restrictions or encumbrances
relating thereto and, at its own cost and expense, shall repair all damage and clean up or perform
any remedial action necessary relating to any Hazardous Materials or contamination caused by
Tenant&#146;s operation. Tenant, at its sole cost and expense, shall, following Landlord&#146;s request,
remove any alterations or improvements that are contaminated or contain Hazardous Materials.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 12pt">21. <U>CONDEMNATION</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">21.1 <U>Termination of Lease</U>. If the Premises or any portion thereof are Taken under the
power of eminent domain, or sold by Landlord under the threat of the exercise of such power, this
Lease shall terminate as to the part so Taken as of the date that the condemning authority takes
possession. This Lease shall remain in full force and effect with respect to the remaining portion
of the Premises. If more than fifty percent (50%) of the square footage of the Building is taken
or sold under such threat, Tenant may terminate this Lease as of the date that the condemning
authority takes possession by delivery of written notice of such election within twenty (20)&nbsp;days
after such party has been notified of the Taking or, in the absence thereof, within twenty (20)
days after the condemning authority shall have taken possession. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Tenant&#146;s right to terminate this Lease under the preceding sentence is contingent upon all
leasehold mortgages (if any) of Tenant being paid in full.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">21.2 <U>Rent Reduction; Tenant&#146;s Obligation To Repair</U>. If this Lease is not terminated
by Landlord or Tenant, it shall remain in full force and effect as to the portion of the Premises
remaining; provided, however, that the Monthly Rent shall be reduced by the proportion that the
floor area of the Building taken bears to the original floor area of the Building. In such event
Tenant, at Tenant&#146;s sole cost and expense, but subject to the availability of condemnation proceeds
therefor, shall restore the Premises to a complete unit of like quality and character, except as to
size, as existed prior to the date on which the condemning authority took possession.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">21.3 <U>Award</U>. All awards for the Taking of any part of the Premises or proceeds from
the sale made under the threat of the exercise of the power of eminent domain (other than the
portions of such award expressly attributed by the governmental authority to the diminution in
value of the leasehold estate which portion, subject to the rights of any ground lessor, shall be
the property of Tenant) shall be the property of Landlord, whether made for the Taking of the fee,
or as severance damages; provided, however, that Tenant shall be entitled to any award that is made
for damage to Tenant&#146;s trade fixtures and removable personal property, to a portion of the award
necessary to restore the Premises as provided in Paragraph&nbsp;21.2 above, and to compensation for its
moving and relocation expenses.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 12pt">22. <U>DEFAULT PROVISIONS</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">22.1 <U>Events of Default</U>. The occurrence of any of the following shall constitute a
default hereunder (&#147;<U>Default</U>&#148;):


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">22.1.1 The failure of Tenant to pay or cause to be paid when past due, within five (5)&nbsp;days
after written notice, any Rent, monies or other charge required by this Lease to be paid by Tenant;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">22.1.2 The failure of Tenant, within thirty (30)&nbsp;days after notice, to do or cause to be done
any act required by this Lease, or the failure to observe and perform any other provision of this
Lease to be observed or performed by Tenant, other than payment of Rent, monies or charges required
by this Lease. If a cure cannot be made within thirty (30)&nbsp;days, Tenant shall have an additional
reasonable amount of time necessary to complete the cure using its diligent and best efforts.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such failure on the part of Tenant affects the health or
safety of others, or would result in the destruction of property, Tenant shall immediately begin to
cure and shall use its diligent and best efforts in pursuing said cure to completion;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">22.1.3 Tenant&#146;s causing or permitting, without the prior written consent of Landlord, any act
for which this Lease requires Landlord&#146;s prior consent, or if this Lease prohibits such act;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">22.1.4 Any act of bankruptcy caused, suffered or permitted by Tenant or, if Tenant is a
partnership, any general partner of Tenant. For purposes of this Lease, an &#147;act of bankruptcy&#148;
shall include the following: (i)&nbsp;any general assignment or general arrangement for the benefit of
creditors; (ii)&nbsp;the filing of any petition by or against Tenant to have Tenant adjudged a bankrupt,
or a petition for reorganization or arrangement under any law relating to bankruptcy, unless such
petition is filed against Tenant and the same is dismissed within ninety (90)&nbsp;days; (iii)&nbsp;the
appointment of a trustee or receiver to take possession of substantially all of Tenant&#146;s assets
located at the Premises or of Tenant&#146;s interest in this Lease; or (iv)&nbsp;the attachment, execution or
other judicial seizure of substantially all of Tenant&#146;s assets located at the Premises or of
Tenant&#146;s interest in this Lease.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">22.1.5 The occurrence of a Default (as such term is or may hereafter be specifically defined
therein and after giving effect to any applicable notice and cure period) under that certain
Amended and Restated Single Tenant Absolute Net Lease (&#147;<U>Lease</U>&#148;) dated as of December&nbsp;17,
2004, between BMR-6611 Tributary Street LLC, a Maryland limited liability company, and Tenant.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">22.2 <U>Rights of Landlord</U>. Upon the occurrence, and during the continuance, of any
Default, and in addition to any or all other rights or remedies of the Landlord hereunder or by
law, Landlord, without further notice or demand of any kind to Tenant or any other person, shall
have the following rights and remedies:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">22.2.1 Landlord may continue this Lease in full force and effect and enforce all Landlord&#146;s
rights and remedies under this Lease, including the right to recover the Rent as it becomes due and
any other amount necessary to compensate Landlord for all detriment proximately caused by Tenant&#146;s
failure to perform its obligations under this Lease or which, in the ordinary course of things,
would be likely to result therefrom. Landlord may sue monthly, annually or after such equal or
unequal periods as Landlord desires for such amounts due.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">22.2.2 Landlord shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate its damages. Landlord
(whether Landlord elects to continue this Lease in effect or terminate this Lease and Tenant&#146;s
right to possession hereunder) may reenter the Premises or take possession pursuant to legal
proceedings or pursuant to any notice provided by law, and thereafter collect rent from existing
sub-tenants of the Premises, if any, and(or) relet the Premises, in whole or in part, to third
parties for Tenant&#146;s account at such rent and upon such reasonable conditions and for such term as
Landlord sees fit. Tenant shall pay to Landlord all costs actually and reasonably incurred in
reletting the Premises or improvements thereon, including, without limitation, broker&#146;s
commissions, repairs, expenses of remodeling required by the reletting and like costs. Landlord
may do all other acts necessary to maintain or preserve the Premises as Landlord deems reasonable
and necessary, including removal of all persons and property, which property may be removed and
stored in a public warehouse or elsewhere at the cost of and for the account of Tenant. If
Landlord is able to so relet, rentals received by Landlord from such reletting shall be applied in
the following order: (i)&nbsp;to the payment of any indebtedness other than Rent due hereunder from
Tenant to Landlord; (ii)&nbsp;to the payment of any cost of such reletting; (iii)&nbsp;to the payment of the
cost of any alterations and repairs; (iv)&nbsp;to the payment of Rent due and unpaid hereunder; (v)&nbsp;to
the payment of any obligations of Tenant under any leasehold mortgage; and (vi)&nbsp;the residue, if
any, shall be held by Landlord and applied in payment of future Rent as the same may become due and
payable hereunder. If reletting results in the actual payment of rentals at less than the Rent
payable during that month by Tenant as required hereunder, Tenant shall pay such deficiency to
Landlord from time to time immediately upon demand therefor by Landlord.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">22.2.3 Landlord, by written notice to Tenant, may terminate this Lease and Tenant&#146;s right to
possession of the Premises. No act by Landlord other than giving written notice to Tenant shall
terminate this Lease. Acts of maintenance, reletting, or the appointment of a receiver on
Landlord&#146;s initiative shall not terminate this Lease. If Landlord elects to terminate this Lease,
Landlord may recover all of the following:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(a)&nbsp;The worth at the time of award of the unpaid Rent which had been earned at the time of
termination. &#147;Worth at the time of award&#148; shall be computed by allowing interest to accrue at the
Default Rate from the first day a breach occurs.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(b)&nbsp;The worth at the time of award of the amount by which the unpaid Rent which would have
been earned after termination until the time of award exceeds the amount of such rental loss that
the Tenant proves could have been reasonably avoided. &#147;Worth at the time of award&#148; shall be
determined by allowing interest at the Default Rate from the first day a breach occurs.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(c)&nbsp;The worth at the time of award of the amount by which the unpaid Rent for the balance of
the term after the time of award exceeds the amount of such rental loss that the Tenant proves
could be reasonably avoided. &#147;Worth at the time of award&#148; shall be computed by discounting such
amount at the discount rate of the Federal Reserve Bank situated nearest the Premises at the time
of award plus six percent (6%).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(d)&nbsp;Any other amount necessary to compensate Landlord for all the detriment proximately caused
by Tenant&#146;s failure to perform its obligations under this Lease or which in the ordinary course of
events would be likely to result therefrom including, but not limited to, expenses of reletting,
reasonable attorneys&#146; fees, costs of alterations and repairs, filing fees and any other expenses
customarily resulting from obtaining possession of Premises and releasing.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(e)&nbsp;At Landlord&#146;s election, such other amounts in addition to or in lieu of the foregoing as
may be permitted from time to time by applicable Maryland law.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">22.2.4 If Tenant shall be in Default in the observance or performance of any term or covenant
on Tenant&#146;s part to be observed or performed under this Lease, Landlord may perform (but is not
obligated to do so) the same for the account of Tenant, and if Landlord makes expenditures or
incurs any obligation for the payment of money thereby, including, but not limited to, attorneys&#146;
fees in instituting, prosecuting or defending any action or proceeding, such sums paid or
obligations incurred, with interest thereon at the Default Rate, shall be deemed to be Additional
Rent hereunder and shall be paid by Tenant to Landlord (without offset) immediately upon demand
therefor.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">22.2.5 Landlord, where permitted by applicable law, may seek to restrain any breach or
threatened breach of any of Tenant&#146;s obligations hereunder and/or may exercise any and all rights
and remedies of a secured party under applicable law with respect to any property in which Landlord
is granted a security interest under this Lease or otherwise.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">22.3 <U>Cumulative Remedies</U>. Any right or remedy of Landlord under this Lease and any
other right or remedy that Landlord may have at law, in equity or otherwise upon any Default or
breach of any of the Tenant&#146;s obligations hereunder shall be distinct, separate and cumulative
rights or remedies and no right or remedy, whether exercised or not, shall be deemed to be in
exclusion of any other.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">22.4.2 The waiver by Landlord of any breach of any term, covenant or condition herein
contained shall not be deemed to be a waiver of such term, covenant or condition on any subsequent
breach by Tenant. The acceptance of Rent hereunder by Landlord after any such breach shall not be
deemed to be a waiver of any preceding breach by Tenant of any term, covenant or condition of this
Lease, other than the failure of Tenant to pay the particular rental so accepted, regardless of
Landlord&#146;s knowledge of such preceding breach at the time of acceptance of such Rent. No covenant,
term or condition of this Lease or breach thereof by Tenant shall be deemed to have been waived by
Landlord unless such waiver is in a writing executed by Landlord.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">22.4.3 Tenant hereby grants and assigns to Landlord a security interest in all accounts,
inventory, fixtures, equipment and personal property of Tenant originating from or hereafter placed
in, on or about the Premises to secure each and every obligation of Tenant under this Lease. Upon
demand from Landlord, Tenant shall execute, acknowledge and deliver such documents or instruments
as reasonably may be required by Landlord to perfect its security interest in the above described
property.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">22.5 <U>Curing of Default</U>. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Paragraph&nbsp;22, if
an event of Default, other than for the payment of Rent or other monies owing from Tenant to
Landlord hereunder, is of such a nature that the same cannot be cured upon demand by Landlord as
specified in any written notice relating thereto, then such event of Default shall be deemed to be
cured if Tenant upon such notice shall have commenced to cure such Default and shall continue
thereafter with all due diligence to so cure and does so complete the same within a reasonable
period of time.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">22.6 <U>Landlord&#146;s Default</U>. If Landlord shall neglect or fail to perform or observe any
of the covenants, provisions or conditions contained in this Lease on its part to be performed or
observed within thirty (30)&nbsp;days after written notice of default (or if more than thirty (30)&nbsp;days
shall be required because of the nature of the default, if Landlord shall fail to proceed
diligently to cure such default after written notice thereof), Landlord shall be responsible to
Tenant for any foreseeable and unavoidable damages sustained by Tenant as a result of Landlord&#146;s
breach.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">22.7 <U>Tenant&#146;s Right to Perform</U>. If, after such notice to Landlord and Assignee (as
defined in Paragraph&nbsp;22.9 below), if any, Landlord and Assignee shall fail to cure such default as
provided herein, Tenant shall have the right, but not the obligation, to cure any such default at
Landlord&#146;s sole cost and expense including in such expenditure all costs and attorneys&#146; fees
incurred to cure such default or breach of Lease. Tenant shall have no right to terminate this
Lease for any such default by Landlord unless otherwise specifically provided in this Lease.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">22.8 <U>Abatement</U>. Except as expressly otherwise provided herein, Landlord and Tenant
hereby waive the provisions of any statutes, regulations, ordinances, or court decisions which
relate to the abatement of rent or termination of leases when leased property is damaged or
destroyed and agree that such event shall be exclusively governed by the terms of this Lease.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">22.9 <U>Tenant to Notify Mortgagees</U>. If Landlord&#146;s estate in the Premises or any part
thereof is at any time subject to a mortgage or a deed of trust, and if this Lease or the rentals
due from Tenant hereunder are assigned to such mortgagee, trustee or beneficiary (called an
&#147;Assignee&#148; for purposes of this paragraph 22 only) and if Tenant is given written notice thereof,
including the post office address of such Assignee, Tenant shall give written notice to such
Assignee, specifying the default of Landlord in reasonable detail and affording such Assignee a
reasonable opportunity to render performance for and on behalf of Landlord. If and when the
Assignee has rendered performance on behalf of Landlord, such default shall be deemed cured.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">23.&nbsp;<U>LIMITATION OF LANDLORD&#146;S LIABILITY</U>. If Landlord is in default of this Lease, and
as a consequence, Tenant recovers a money judgment against Landlord, the judgment shall be
satisfied only out of the proceeds of sale received on execution of the judgment and levy against
the right, title, and interest of Landlord in the Premises, and out of rent or other income from
the Premises receivable by Landlord or out of the consideration received by Landlord from the sale
or other disposition of all or any part of Landlord&#146;s right, title, and interest in the Premises.
Neither Landlord nor Landlord&#146;s Agents shall be personally liable for any deficiency except to the
extent liability is based upon willful and intentional misconduct. If Landlord is a partnership,
joint venture, or limited liability company, the partners or members of such partnership or limited
liability company, as the case may be, shall not be personally liable, and no partner or member of
Landlord (or of any affiliated entity) shall be sued or named as a party in any suit or action, or
service of process be made against any partner or member of Landlord (or of any affiliated entity),
except as may be necessary to secure jurisdiction of the partnership, joint venture, or limited
liability company or to the extent liability is caused by willful and intentional misconduct. If
Landlord is a corporation, the shareholders, directors, officers, employees, and/or agents of such
corporation shall not be personally liable, and no shareholder, director, officer, employee, or
agent of Landlord shall be sued or named as a party in any suit or action, or service of process be
made against any shareholder, director, officer, employee or agent of Landlord, except as may be
necessary to secure jurisdiction of the corporation. No partner, member, shareholder, director,
employee, or agent of Landlord (or of any affiliated entity) shall be required to answer or
otherwise plead to any service of process and no judgment will be taken or writ of execution levied
against any partner, member shareholder, director, employee, or agent of Landlord.

subordinate its rights hereunder to the lien of any mortgage or deed of trust now or hereafter in
force against the land and buildings comprised of the Premises of which the Premises are a part,
and upon any building hereafter placed upon the Premises, and to all advances made or hereafter to
be made upon the security thereof; provided that Tenant obtains a non-disturbance agreement
reasonably acceptable to Tenant from any such mortgagee or deed of trust beneficiary.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">24.2 <U>Attornment</U>. If any proceedings are brought for foreclosure, or in the event of
the exercise of the power of sale under any mortgage or deed of trust made by or to which the
Landlord is subject covering the Premises, Tenant shall attorn to the purchaser or lessor under
said lease upon any such foreclosure, sale or lease termination and recognize such purchaser or
lessor as the Landlord under this Lease; provided, however, that the purchaser or lessor shall
acquire and accept the Premises subject to this Lease.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">24.3 <U>Execution of Documents by Tenant</U>. Tenant, upon request of any party in interest,
shall duly execute in recordable form such instruments and certificates as are necessary to carry
out the intent of this Paragraph&nbsp;24.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">25.&nbsp;<U>QUIET POSSESSION</U>. Subject to the provisions and matters referred to in Paragraph
14 of this Lease, Tenant, upon paying the Rent and performing the covenants and conditions of this
Lease, may quietly have, hold and enjoy the Premises during the Lease Term.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 12pt">26. <U>MISCELLANEOUS</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">26.1 <U>Captions and Terms</U>. The captions to all paragraphs of this Lease are for
convenience only, are not a part of this Lease, and do not in any way limit or amplify the terms
and provisions of this Lease. The masculine pronoun used herein shall include the feminine or the
neuter as the case may be, and the use of the singular shall include the plural when appropriate.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">26.2 <U>Obligations of Successors</U>. Each of the provisions hereof are to be construed as
covenants and agreements as though the words importing such covenants and agreements were used in

benefit of the parties hereto, and their respective heirs, legal representatives, successors and
assigns (subject to any restrictions on assignment).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">26.3 <U>No Joint Venture</U>. Nothing contained in this Lease shall be deemed or construed
as creating a partnership, joint venture or any other relationship between the parties hereto other
than Landlord and Tenant according to the provisions contained herein, or cause Landlord to be
responsible in any way for the debts or obligations of Tenant or any other party.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">26.4 <U>Authority of Tenant</U>. If Tenant is a corporation, the persons executing this
Lease on behalf of Tenant hereby covenant and warrant that they have the authority to enter into
this Lease, that Tenant is a corporation in good standing in the state of its origination, all
steps have been taken prior to the date hereof to qualify Tenant to do business in the State of
Maryland, all franchise and corporate taxes have been paid to date, and that all future forms,
reports, fees and other documents necessary to comply with applicable laws will be filed when due.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">26.5 <U>No Right of Redemption</U>. Tenant hereby expressly waives any and all rights of
redemption granted by or under any present or future laws in the event of Tenant being lawfully
evicted or dispossessed for any cause, or in the event of Landlord obtaining possession of the
premises by reason of a Default by Tenant hereunder.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">26.6 <U>Holding Over</U>. If Tenant remains in possession of the Premises (a)&nbsp;after the
expiration of the Lease Term without executing a new lease, or (b)&nbsp;after Landlord has declared a
forfeiture by reason of a Default by Tenant, then such holding over shall be construed as a tenancy
at sufferance from month-to-month, subject to all the conditions, provisions and obligations of
this Lease insofar as they are applicable to a month-to-month tenancy, except that the Monthly Rent
shall be one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of the Monthly Rent last due, payable monthly in
advance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Tenant fails to vacate the Premises and fulfill all of
its obligations hereunder at the end of the Lease Term, Tenant also shall be liable for all damages
incurred by Landlord by reason of the latter&#146;s inability to deliver possession of the Premises or
any portion thereof to any other person.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">26.7 <U>Brokers</U>. Tenant and Landlord each warrants and represents that it has had no
dealings with any real estate brokers or agents in connection with the negotiation of this Lease
other than Colliers Pinkard and CB Richard Ellis, and it knows of no other real estate broker or
agent who is entitled to a commission in connection with this Lease. Tenant and Landlord each
shall defend, indemnify and hold the other harmless from and against any and all Claims by any
person for any finder&#146;s fees or brokerage fees incurred as a result of any action by such
indemnifying party.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">26.8 <U>Non-Merger</U>. There shall be no merger of this Lease, or of the leasehold estate
created hereby, with the fee estate in and to the Premises by reason of the fact that this Lease,
or the leasehold estate created hereby, or any interest in either thereof, may be held directly or
indirectly by or for the account of any person who shall own the fee estate in and to the Premises,
or any portion thereof, and no such merger shall occur unless and until all persons at the time
having any interest in the fee estate and all persons having any interest in this Lease or the
leasehold estate, shall join in a written instrument effecting such merger.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">26.9 <U>Recordation of Lease</U>. Neither Landlord nor Tenant shall record this Lease or any
other document relating to this Lease without the prior written consent of the other party.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">26.10 <U>Notices</U>. No notice, request, demand, instruction or other document to be given

Landlord may enter the Premises at reasonable times upon reasonable prior notice and when

tenants, lenders, investors, or purchasers. In exercising its rights under this Paragraph&nbsp;26.20.2,
Landlord and Landlord&#146;s invitees shall not unreasonably interfere with Tenant&#146;s use or occupancy of
the Premises, shall abide by Tenant&#146;s safety practices and, except for true emergencies in which
the health or safety of persons are in immediate danger, when necessary to save the destruction of
significant property or when Landlord has provided reasonable prior notice (including the timing
and scope) of an inspection by a prospective purchaser, investor, lender or insurer of the
Premises, shall not under any circumstances have access to areas with confidential or proprietary
information related to Tenant&#146;s business.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">26.20.3 <U>Waiver</U>. Landlord shall be permitted to enter upon the Premises in

unmodified and in full force and effect or, if modified, stating the nature of such modification.
Tenant&#146;s statement shall include such other details as may be reasonably requested by Landlord.
Any such statement may be relied upon conclusively by any existing or prospective purchaser or
lender. Tenant&#146;s failure to deliver such statements within such time shall be conclusive upon
Tenant that this Lease is in full force and effect, except to the extent any modification has been
represented in writing by Landlord to such prospective purchaser or lender, that there are no
uncured defaults in Landlord&#146;s performance, and that not more than one month&#146;s rent has been paid

performance at law and shall have such other remedies as are reserved to it under this Lease;
provided, however that in no event shall Landlord or Tenant be responsible in monetary damages for
such failure to give consent unless said consent is withheld maliciously or in bad faith.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">26.24 <U>Binding Effect</U>. This Lease shall not be effective until fully executed by both

submitting a bill without first having to forward payment for the expenses to Landlord. Tenant
shall at Tenant&#146;s sole cost and expense be responsible for the management of the Premises, shall
maintain the landscaping, parking lot and shall make all additional repairs and alterations as
required to maintain the property in first class condition.

persons sophisticated and knowledgeable in the matters dealt with in this Lease. In addition, each

of law or legal decision that would require interpretation of any ambiguities in this Lease against
the party that has drafted it is not applicable and is waived. The provisions of this Lease shall
