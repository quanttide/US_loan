ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.

      The information provided in Item 1.03 of this Current Report on Form 8-K
regarding the DIP Facility is incorporated into this Item 1.01.

ITEM 1.03 BANKRUPTCY OR RECEIVERSHIP.

      As reported on its Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission on December 6, 2004 (the "Petition Form 8-K"), on
November 30, 2004 (the "Petition Date"), Amcast Industrial Corporation
("Amcast") and its subsidiaries (the "Subsidiaries," and together with Amcast,
the "Companies") filed voluntary petitions in the United States Bankruptcy Court
for the Southern District of Ohio (the "Bankruptcy Court") seeking
reorganization relief under the provisions of Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the
United States Code (the "Bankruptcy Code"). The Companies continue to operate
their businesses as debtors-in-possession under the jurisdiction of the
Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the
Bankruptcy Code and the orders of the Bankruptcy Court.

      On December 15, 2004, Amcast entered into a Debtor-In-Possession Credit
Agreement (the "DIP Facility") with Heritage Bank, SSB ("Agent"), Citigroup
Financial Products, Inc. ("Citigroup"), and Steel Partners II, L.P. ("Steel
Partners," and together with Agent and Citigroup, the "Lenders"). As reported in
the Petition Form 8-K, the terms of the DIP Facility received interim approval
by the Bankruptcy Court on December 3, 2004, but the definitive agreement
remains subject to final approval by the Bankruptcy Court. A copy of the DIP
Facility is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by
reference. The terms contained in the executed DIP Facility, as described
below, do not differ materially from the terms of the DIP Facility reported in
the Petition Form 8-K.

      As reported in the Petition Form 8-K, the DIP Facility provides for, among
other things, a commitment of up to $15 million to finance Amcast's working
capital requirements during the pendency of the bankruptcy cases, and a
commitment of up to $87 million in other financing to fund operations under
Amcast's plan of reorganization, which has yet to be submitted to the Bankruptcy
Court. Obligations under the DIP Facility are guaranteed by the Subsidiaries and
are secured by a superpriority first lien in favor of the Lenders thereunder
over all of the Companies' assets (for purposes of the remaining disclosures in
this Current Report on Form 8-K, the Subsidiaries will be considered primarily
liable with Amcast on the obligations under the DIP Facility).

      Advances will be made to the Companies under the DIP Facility according to
a budget that has been agreed upon by Amcast and its lenders, and will be
subject to a borrowing base calculated as a percentage of the Companies'
accounts receivable and inventory, less reserves and fees. Principal repayments
will be made on a daily basis from Companies' cash collections. Interest on
borrowings under the DIP Facility accrues at a variable prime rate plus 1.50%
per annum (the sum of which shall not be less than 4.75% per annum). Interest on
borrowings made under the DIP Facility is payable on a monthly basis.

<PAGE>

      The DIP Facility subjects the Companies to certain obligations, including
the delivery of financials reports, schedules, and other materials concerning
the operations and financial performance of the Companies. Furthermore, the DIP
Facility subjects the Companies to numerous covenants, including limitations on
the Companies' uses of the funds provided pursuant to the DIP Facility,
limitations on the incurrence or payment of indebtedness, creation of liens,
entering into investments, and declaring and paying dividends, and procedures
for the collection of the Companies' accounts receivable. In addition, repayment
by the Companies under the DIP Facility may be accelerated following certain
events of default including, but not limited to, (a) the Companies' failure to
pay when due any principal, interest, premium, or fee under the DIP Facility,
(b) the conversion of any of the bankruptcy cases to a case under Chapter 7 of
the Bankruptcy Code or the appointment of a trustee pursuant to Chapter 11 of
the Bankruptcy Code, (c) any event occurring after the commencement of the
bankruptcy cases that would have a material adverse effect on the Companies, (d)
the filing of a plan of reorganization by any of the Companies that does not
provide for payment in full of the Companies' obligations to the lenders under
the DIP Facility, (e) certain events relating to the termination of the
Companies' pension plans, (f) the dismissal or resignation of the Chief
Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer of Amcast and a vacancy in either
such position for more than 15 days, and (g) the occurrence of any breach or
event of default under, and/or the failure by any of the Companies to pay, debts
entered into after the Petition Date, assumed during the course of the
bankruptcy cases, or otherwise required to be paid during the pendency of the
bankruptcy cases, in each case in an amount in excess of $100,000.

      The Companies are required to reimburse Agent for expenses incurred in
connection with the negotiation and consummation of the transactions
contemplated under the DIP Facility, and the continued administration and
enforcement of the agreements required thereunder. Additionally, the Companies
are required to indemnify and hold harmless Agent and the Lenders (each, an
"Indemnitee") from expenses and costs (of any kind or nature whatsoever)
associated with (i) the extension of credit or the use of the proceeds provided
under the DIP Facility and (ii) certain environmental matters, except for
expenses and costs resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of
an Indemnitee.

      The DIP Facility terminates on the earlier of (i) March 30, 2005 (subject
to extension for up to 45 days upon the request of Amcast), (ii) the
acceleration of obligations following the occurrence of an event of default,
(iii) the closing date of a sale of all or substantially all of the Companies'
assets in violation of the DIP Facility, (iv) the effective date of a
reorganization plan confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court providing for payment in
full of all obligations owing under the DIP Facility, or (v) the entry of an
order dismissing or converting the bankruptcy cases.

      On December 15, 2004, the Companies also executed a Lockup and Voting
Agreement (the "Lock Up Agreement") with certain of the Companies' pre-petition
lenders pursuant to which those lenders would agree to vote in favor of and
support the Companies' proposed financial restructuring plan, subject to the
terms and conditions contained in the Lock Up Agreement.

each DIP Lender severally agrees to make revolving loans ("LOANS") to Borrower
from time to time as set forth herein equal to such DIP Lender's Commitment
Percentage of the Loans requested by Borrower hereunder, provided that after

<PAGE>

satisfied (including, without limitation, the condition precedent that the Total
Outstandings not exceed the Loan Limit plus any other then outstanding
Protective Advances), to make Loans to Borrower on behalf of the DIP Lenders
which Required DIP Lenders, in their reasonable business judgment, deem
necessary or desirable (1) to preserve or protect the business conducted by
Borrower, the Collateral, or any portion thereof, (2) to enhance the likelihood
of, or maximize the amount of, repayment of the Loans and other Obligations, or
(3) to pay any amount chargeable to Borrower pursuant to the terms of this DIP
Credit Agreement, interest payments and costs, fees and expenses as described in
SECTION 10.1 and SECTION 10.4 (any of the advances described in this SECTION
2.1(a)(ii) being hereafter referred to as "PROTECTIVE ADVANCES"); provided that
(i) Protective Advances may only be made with the prior approval of Required DIP

outstanding at any time, exclusive of those made pursuant to the preceding
CLAUSE (3), shall not exceed $1,000,000, and (iii) Agent shall be prohibited
from making Protective Advances to the extent the making thereof would cause the
Total Outstandings (inclusive of Protective Advances) to exceed the Aggregate
Commitment.

            (b) Advancing Loans.

            (i) Borrower shall deliver to Agent a Notice of Borrowing with
respect to each proposed Borrowing (other than Protective Advances), such Notice
of Borrowing to be delivered no later than 11:00 a.m. (Central time) on the
second (2nd) Business Day prior to such proposed Borrowing. Once given, a Notice
of Borrowing shall be irrevocable and Borrower shall be bound thereby.

            (ii) Borrower hereby authorizes DIP Lenders and Agent to make Loans
based on electronic notices made by any Person which Agent, in good faith,
believes to be acting on behalf of Borrower, but only after Agent shall have
established procedures acceptable to Agent for accepting electronic Notices of
Borrowing, as indicated by Agent's written confirmation thereof. Unless
otherwise specified in the applicable Notice of Borrowing, each Loan shall be
advanced to Borrower's Account.

            (c) Termination Date. The Aggregate Commitment shall terminate upon
the earliest to occur of (i) the Commitment Expiry Date, (ii) the date on which
Agent or Required DIP Lenders elect to terminate the Aggregate Commitment and/or
accelerate the Obligations pursuant to SECTION 9.2, (iii) the occurrence of an
Event of Default under SECTION 9.1(s), (iv) the sale of all or substantially all
of Borrower's assets in violation of SECTION 5.6, or (v) the effective date of a
confirmed Bankruptcy Plan that provides for payment in full of the Obligations
or is otherwise acceptable to Agent and the DIP Lenders (such earliest date
being the "TERMINATION DATE"), and there shall become due and Borrower shall pay

on at least three (3) Business Days prior written notice to Agent and the
Committee specifying the date and amount of such reduction, permanently reduce
the Aggregate Commitment in part; provided that each reduction shall be in an
amount equal to $1,000,000 or a higher integral multiple of $1,000,000.

            SECTION 2.2 INTEREST, INTEREST CALCULATIONS AND CERTAIN FEES.

            (a) Interest. The Loans and the other Obligations shall bear
interest at the sum of the Prime Rate plus the applicable Prime Rate Margin;
provided, however that if the Prime Rate ever falls below 4.75% per annum, the
Prime Rate shall be deemed to be equal to 4.75% per annum.

            (b) Unused Line Fee. From and following the Effective Date, Borrower
shall pay Agent, for the benefit of the DIP Lenders in accordance with their
respective Pro Rata Shares, a fee (the "UNUSED LINE FEE") in an amount equal to
(1) (A) the Aggregate Commitment less (B) the average daily balance of the Total
Outstandings during the preceding calendar month, multiplied by (2)
three-quarters of one percent (0.75%) per annum. The Unused Line Fee is to be

            (c) Closing Fee. Borrower shall pay to Agent, for the benefit of the
DIP Lenders, in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares, a closing fee

$6,500 per month, payable upon entry by the Bankruptcy Court of the Interim
Financing Order and on the last day of each month. Each portion of the
Administration Fee shall be fully earned when due and payable and shall not be
subject to rebate, refund or proration for any reason.

            (e) Structuring Fees. Upon the effective date of the Bankruptcy

            (f) Audit Fee. Borrower shall pay to Agent, an audit fee (the "AUDIT
FEE") equal to $800 per day per auditor for each audit performed by employees of
Agent or Highland plus reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (other than charges for
each auditor, which charges shall be satisfied from the $800 per day per auditor
amount) incurred by such auditors, plus all reasonable actual costs and charges
of third party appraisers and third party professionals engaged by Agent or
Highland to review, audit and monitor the assets of the Credit Parties.

            (g) Computation of Interest and Related Fees; Interest Payment
Dates. All interest and fees under each DIP Loan Document shall be calculated on
the basis of a three hundred sixty (360) day year for the actual number of days
elapsed. The date of funding of a Loan shall be included in the calculation of
interest. The date of payment of a Loan shall be excluded from the calculation
of interest. If a Loan is repaid on the same day that it is made, one (1) day's
interest shall be charged. Interest on all Loans is payable in arrears on the
last day of each calendar month and on the maturity of such Loans, whether by
acceleration or otherwise.

                                       21

<PAGE>

            SECTION 2.3 PREPAYMENTS.

            (a) Mandatory Prepayments. There shall become due and payable and
Borrower shall prepay the Loans to the extent required by SECTION 2.3(c) in the
following amounts and at the following times:

            (i) on the date on which any Credit Party (or Agent as loss payee or
assignee) receives any payment which constitutes Major Casualty Proceeds, an
amount equal to the amount of such payment; provided that the recipient (other
than Agent) of any payment which constitutes Major Casualty Proceeds may
reinvest such payment within thirty (30) days, in replacement assets comparable
to the assets giving rise to such payment; provided that the aggregate amount
which may be reinvested by each Credit Party pursuant to the preceding proviso
may not exceed $100,000 in any Fiscal Year without written consent from Required
DIP Lenders;

            (ii) on the date of receipt by any Credit Party of the proceeds from
the issuance and sale of any Debt (other than the Loans) or equity securities,
an amount equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the Net Cash Proceeds of such
issuance and sale;

            (iii) on the date of receipt by any Credit Party of the proceeds of

Cash Proceeds of such Asset Disposition; provided that such Credit Party may
reinvest such proceeds within sixty (60) days of receipt thereof in assets
useful in such Credit Party's business; provided that the aggregate amount which
may be reinvested by each Credit Party pursuant to the preceding proviso may not
exceed $100,000 in any Fiscal Year without written consent from Required DIP
Lenders; and

            (iv) if at any time the Total Outstandings exceed the Loan Limit,
then, on the next succeeding Business Day, Borrower shall repay the Loans in the
manner specified in SECTION 2.5(a) in an aggregate amount equal to such excess.

Any amounts permitted to be reinvested pursuant to the preceding CLAUSES (i) or
(iii) shall be immediately applied by Borrower as a prepayment against then
outstanding Loans, and Agent shall establish a reserve (the "REINVESTMENT
RESERVE") against the Loan Limit in an amount equal to such permitted
reinvestment amount. So long as no Event of Default then exists, Agent shall
permit Borrowings to finance the making of reinvestments permitted pursuant to
the preceding CLAUSES (i) or (iii), and shall concurrently reduce the
Reinvestment Reserve by an equivalent amount. Any remaining portion of the
Reinvestment Reserve shall be reduced to zero (0) upon the expiration of the
applicable reinvestment periods pursuant to the preceding CLAUSES (i) or (iii)
and the Aggregate Commitment shall be immediately reduced by such amount.

            (b) Optional Prepayments. Borrower may from time to time, subject to
the provisions of SECTION 2.3(c), prepay the Loans in whole or in part; provided
that any such partial prepayment shall be in an amount equal to $100,000 or a
higher integral multiple of $25,000. No payment pursuant to this SECTION 2.3(b)

                                       22

<PAGE>

            (c) All Prepayments. Prior to each prepayment pursuant to this
SECTION 2.3, Borrower shall give at least one (1) Business Day's prior written
notice to Agent specifying the date and amount of such prepayment and Agent
shall notify each DIP Lender of such notice. Any prepayment of a Loan shall
include interest on the principal amount being repaid. Any amounts prepaid under
this SECTION 2.3 shall be applied in accordance with SECTION 9.5 hereof.

            SECTION 2.4 NOTES.

            If requested by any DIP Lender, the portion of the Loans made by
such DIP Lender shall be evidenced by a promissory note executed by Borrower (a
"NOTE") in an original principal amount equal to such DIP Lender's Pro Rata
Share of the Aggregate Commitment.

            SECTION 2.5 GENERAL PROVISIONS REGARDING PAYMENT; LOAN ACCOUNT.

            (a) All payments to be made by Borrower under any DIP Loan Document,
including payments of principal and interest on the Loans, and all fees,
expenses, indemnities and reimbursements, shall be made without set-off or
counterclaim, in lawful money of the United States of America and in immediately
available funds. If any payment hereunder becomes due and payable on a day other
than a Business Day, such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding
Business Day and, with respect to payments of principal, interest thereon shall
be payable at the then applicable rate during such extension. Borrower shall
make all payments in immediately available funds to the Payment Account before
noon (Central time) on the date when due. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this SECTION 2.5(a), Agent shall be permitted, in its sole
discretion, but subject to the limitations set forth in SECTION 2.1(a)(ii), to
satisfy any of the payment obligations described in this SECTION 2.5(a) through
the making of Protective Advances.

            (b) Agent shall maintain a loan account (the "LOAN ACCOUNT") on its
books to record Loans and other extensions of credit made by the DIP Lenders
hereunder or under any other DIP Loan Document, and all payments thereon made by
Borrower. All entries in the Loan Account shall be made in accordance with
Agent's customary accounting practices as in effect from time to time. The
balance in the Loan Account, as recorded on Agent's most recent printout or
other written statement, shall be conclusive and binding evidence of the amounts
due and owing to Agent by Borrower absent clear and convincing evidence to the
contrary, subject to review by the Bankruptcy Court; provided that any failure
to so record or any error in so recording shall not limit or otherwise affect
Borrower's duty to pay all amounts owing hereunder or under any other DIP Loan
Document. Unless Borrower notifies Agent in writing of any objection to any such
printout or statement (specifically describing the basis for such objection)
within thirty (30) days after the date of receipt thereof, it shall be deemed
final, binding and conclusive upon Borrower in all respects as to all matters
reflected therein.

            SECTION 2.6 MAXIMUM INTEREST.

            (a) In no event shall the interest charged with respect to the Loans
or any other Obligations of Borrower under any DIP Loan Document exceed the
maximum amount permitted under the laws of the State of Texas or of any other
applicable jurisdiction.

                                       23

<PAGE>

            (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or elsewhere, if
at any time the rate of interest payable hereunder or under any Note or other
DIP Loan Document (the "STATED RATE") would exceed the highest rate of interest
permitted under any applicable law to be charged (the "MAXIMUM LAWFUL RATE"),
then for so long as the Maximum Lawful Rate would be so exceeded, the rate of
interest payable shall be equal to the Maximum Lawful Rate; provided that if at
any time thereafter the Stated Rate is less than the Maximum Lawful Rate,
Borrower shall, to the extent permitted by law, continue to pay interest at the
Maximum Lawful Rate until such time as the total interest received is equal to
the total interest which would have received had the Stated Rate been (but for
the operation of this provision) the interest rate payable. Thereafter, the
interest rate payable shall be the Stated Rate unless and until the Stated Rate
again would exceed the Maximum Lawful Rate, in which event this provision shall
again apply.

            (c) In no event shall the total interest received by any DIP Lender
exceed the amount which it could lawfully have received had the interest been
calculated for the full term hereof at the Maximum Lawful Rate. If,
notwithstanding the prior sentence, any DIP Lender has received interest
hereunder in excess of the Maximum Lawful Rate, such excess amount shall be
applied to the reduction of the principal balance of the Loans or to other
amounts (other than interest) payable hereunder, and if no such principal or
other amounts are then outstanding, such excess or part thereof remaining shall
be paid to Borrower.

            (d) In computing interest payable with reference to the Maximum
Lawful Rate applicable to any DIP Lender, such interest shall be calculated at a
daily rate equal to the Maximum Lawful Rate divided by the number of days in the
year in which such calculation is made.

            SECTION 2.7 TAXES.

            (a) All payments of principal and interest on the Loans and all
other amounts payable hereunder shall be made free and clear of and without
deduction for any present or future income, excise, stamp, documentary, excise,
property or franchise taxes and other taxes, fees, duties, levies, withholdings
or other charges of any nature whatsoever imposed by any taxing authority,
excluding taxes imposed on or measured by Agent's or any DIP Lender's net income
by the jurisdictions under which Agent or such DIP Lender is organized or
conducts business (all non-excluded items being called "TAXES"). If any
withholding or deduction from any payment to be made by Borrower hereunder is
required in respect of any Taxes pursuant to any applicable law, rule or
regulation, then Borrower will: (a) pay directly to the relevant authority the
full amount required to be so withheld or deducted; (b) promptly forward to
Agent an official receipt or other documentation satisfactory to Agent
evidencing such payment to such authority; and (c) pay to Agent for the account
of Agent and DIP Lenders such additional amount or amounts as is necessary to
ensure that the net amount actually received by Agent and each DIP Lender will
equal the full amount Agent and such DIP Lender would have received had no such
withholding or deduction been required. If any Taxes are directly asserted
against Agent or any DIP Lender with respect to any payment received by Agent or
such DIP Lender hereunder, Agent or such DIP Lender may pay such Taxes and
Borrower will promptly pay such additional amounts (including any penalty,
interest or expense) as is necessary in order that the net amount received by
such Person after the payment of such Taxes (including any Taxes on such
additional amount) shall equal the amount such Person would have received had
such Taxes not been asserted so long as such amounts have accrued on or after
the day which is one hundred

                                       24

<PAGE>

eighty (180) days prior to the date on which Agent or such DIP Lender first made
demand therefor.

            (b) If Borrower fail to pay any Taxes when due to the appropriate
taxing authority or fails to remit to Agent, for the account of Agent and the
respective DIP Lenders, the required receipts or other required documentary
evidence, Borrower shall indemnify Agent and DIP Lenders for any incremental
Taxes, interest or penalties that may become payable by Agent or any DIP Lender
as a result of any such failure.

            (c) Each DIP Lender that (i) is organized under the laws of a
jurisdiction other than the United States of America and (ii)(A) is a party
hereto on the Closing Date or (B) becomes an assignee of an interest under this
DIP Credit Agreement under SECTION 12.6(a) after the Closing Date (unless such
DIP Lender was already a DIP Lender hereunder immediately prior to such
assignment) shall execute and deliver to Borrower and Agent one or more (as
Borrower or Agent may reasonably request) Forms W-8ECI, W-8BEN, W-8IMY (as
applicable) or other applicable form, certificate or document prescribed by the
United States Internal Revenue Service certifying as to such DIP Lender's
entitlement to exemption from withholding or deduction of Taxes. Borrower shall
not be required to pay additional amounts to any DIP Lender pursuant to this
SECTION 2.7 to the extent that the obligation to pay such additional amounts
would not have arisen but for the failure of such DIP Lender to comply with this
paragraph.

            SECTION 2.8 CAPITAL ADEQUACY.

            If any DIP Lender shall reasonably determine that any change in, or
the adoption or phase-in of, any applicable law, rule or regulation regarding
capital adequacy, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof
by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with
the interpretation or administration thereof, or the compliance by any DIP
Lender or any Person controlling such DIP Lender with any request or directive
regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any such
authority, central bank or comparable agency, has or would have the effect of
reducing the rate of return on such DIP Lender's or such controlling Person's
capital as a consequence of such DIP Lender's obligations hereunder to a level
below that which such DIP Lender or such controlling Person could have achieved
but for such change, adoption, phase-in or compliance (taking into consideration
such DIP Lender's or such controlling Person's policies with respect to capital
adequacy) by an amount deemed by such DIP Lender or such controlling Person to
be material, then from time to time, upon demand by such DIP Lender (which
demand shall be accompanied by a statement setting forth the basis for such
demand and a calculation of the amount thereof in reasonable detail, a copy of
which shall be furnished to Agent), Borrower shall pay to such DIP Lender such
additional amount as will compensate such DIP Lender or such controlling Person
for such reduction, so long as such amounts have accrued on or after the day
which is one hundred eighty (180) days prior to the date on which such DIP
Lender first made demand therefor.

            SECTION 2.9 ANCILLARY SERVICES.

            Borrower may from time to time request, and Agent or any DIP Lender
that is an Affiliate of a Designated DIP Lender Affiliate may, in its sole
discretion, from time to time

                                       25

<PAGE>

arrange for Borrower to obtain from Agent or any Designated DIP Lender
Affiliate, Ancillary Services although Borrower is not required to do so. To the
extent Ancillary Services are provided, Borrower agrees to indemnify and hold
Agent and DIP Lenders harmless from any and all costs and obligations now or
hereafter incurred by Agent or any DIP Lenders which arise from the indemnity
given by Agent or any DIP Lender to any Designated Lender Affiliates related to
such Ancillary Services. The agreement contained in this SECTION 2.9 shall
survive termination of this DIP Credit Agreement. Borrower acknowledges and
agrees that the obtaining of Ancillary Services (a) is in the sole and absolute
discretion of Agent and each Designated DIP Lender Affiliate, and (b) is subject
to all rules and regulations of Agent and each applicable Designated DIP Lender
Affiliate.

                                   ARTICLE 3

or any portion of the Collateral (including, without limitation, Inventory, Real

from time to time, if Agent or any DIP Lender determines that obtaining

Agent may itself, or through any of its officers, employees or agents, obtain,

            Each Credit Party (i) will pay and discharge, at or before maturity,
all of their respective obligations and liabilities, including tax liabilities,
except for such obligations and/or liabilities which are the subject of a
Permitted Contest or are otherwise effectively stayed or the nonpayment or
nondischarge of which could not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect, (ii) will maintain, in accordance with GAAP, appropriate
reserves for the accrual of all of their respective obligations and liabilities
and (iii) will not breach, or permit to exist any default under, the terms of
any lease, commitment, contract, instrument or obligation to which it is a
party, or by which its properties or assets are bound, except for such breaches
or defaults which could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect or are otherwise effectively stayed.

            SECTION 4.3 CONDUCT OF BUSINESS AND MAINTENANCE OF EXISTENCE.

            Each Credit Party will continue to engage in business of the same
general type as they now conduct and will preserve, renew and keep in full force
and effect, their respective existence and their respective rights, privileges
and franchises necessary or desirable in the normal conduct of business.

            SECTION 4.4 MAINTENANCE OF PROPERTY; INSURANCE.

            (a) Each Credit Party will keep all property useful and necessary in
its business in good working order and condition, ordinary wear and tear
excepted.

                                       38

<PAGE>

            (b) Borrower will maintain, and will cause each Guarantor to
maintain, (i) physical damage insurance on all real and personal property on an
all risks basis (including the perils of flood and quake), covering the repair
and replacement cost (subject to the deductibles provided for in such policies)
of all such property and consequential loss coverage for business interruption
and public liability insurance (including products/completed operations
liability coverage) in each case of the kinds customarily carried or maintained
by Persons of established reputation engaged in similar businesses and in
amounts acceptable to Agent and (ii) such other insurance coverage in such
amounts and with respect to such risks as Agent may reasonably request. All such
insurance shall be provided by insurers having an A.M. Best policyholders rating
reasonably acceptable to Agent.

            (c) On or prior to the Effective Date, each Credit Party will cause
Agent to be named as an additional insured, assignee and loss payee, as
applicable, on each insurance policy required to be maintained pursuant to this
SECTION 4.4 pursuant to endorsements in form and content acceptable to Agent.
Each Credit Party will deliver to Agent and the DIP Lenders (i) on the Effective
Date, a certificate from each Credit Party's insurance broker dated such date
showing the amount of coverage as of such date, and that such policies will
include effective waivers (whether under the terms of any such policy or
otherwise) by the insurer of all claims for insurance premiums against all loss
payees and additional insureds and all rights of subrogation against all loss
payees and additional insureds, and that if all or any part of such policy is
canceled, terminated or expires, the insurer will forthwith give notice thereof
to each additional insured and loss payee and that no cancellation, reduction in
amount or material change in coverage thereof shall be effective until at least
thirty (30) days after receipt by each additional insured and loss payee of
written notice thereof, (ii) on an annual basis, and upon the request of any DIP
Lender through Agent from time to time, full information as to the insurance
carried, (iii) within five (5) days of receipt of notice from any insurer, a
copy of any notice of cancellation, nonrenewal or material change in coverage
from that existing on the date of this DIP Credit Agreement and (iv) forthwith,
notice of any cancellation or nonrenewal of coverage by each Credit Party.

            (d) In the event each Credit Party fails to provide Agent with
evidence of the insurance coverage required by this DIP Credit Agreement, Agent
may purchase insurance at each Credit Party's expense to protect Agent's
interests in the Collateral. This insurance may, but need not, protect each
Credit Party's interests. The coverage purchased by Agent may not pay any claim
made by any Credit Party or any claim that is made against any Credit Party in
connection with the Collateral. A Credit Party may later cancel any insurance
purchased by Agent, but only after providing Agent with evidence that such
Credit Party has obtained insurance as required by this DIP Credit Agreement. If
Agent purchases insurance for the Collateral, the Credit Parties will be
responsible for the costs of that insurance, including interest and other
charges imposed by Agent in connection with the placement of the insurance,
until the effective date of the cancellation or expiration of the insurance. The
costs of the insurance may be added to the Obligations. The costs of the
insurance may be more than the cost of insurance each Credit Party is able to
obtain on its own.

            SECTION 4.5 COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS.

            Each Credit Party will comply with the requirements of all
applicable laws, ordinances, rules, regulations, and requirements of
governmental authorities (including

                                       39

<PAGE>

Environmental Laws and ERISA and the rules and regulations thereunder), except
as otherwise permitted by the Bankruptcy Court or where the noncompliance with
which could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

            SECTION 4.6 INSPECTION OF PROPERTY, BOOKS AND RECORDS.

            Each Credit Party will keep proper books of record and account in
accordance with GAAP in which full, true and correct entries shall be made of
all dealings and transactions in relation to its business and activities; and
will permit, at the sole cost of the respective Credit Party, representatives of
Agent and Highland and of any DIP Lender to visit and inspect any of their
respective properties, to examine and make abstracts or copies from any of their
respective books and records, to conduct a collateral audit and analysis of the
Collateral and to discuss their respective affairs, finances and accounts with
their respective officers, employees and independent public accountants as often
as may be warranted in the reasonable credit judgment of the Agent or the
Required DIP Lenders, it being the intent of certain of the DIP Lenders to make
such visits and inspections and conduct such audits and analyses no less
frequently than quarterly (semi-annually for Collateral comprised of Equipment).
In the absence of an Event of Default, Agent or any DIP Lender exercising any
rights pursuant to this SECTION 4.6 shall give such Credit Party commercially
reasonable prior notice of such exercise and shall take reasonable steps not to
interfere with the conduct of Borrower's business during such inspection. No
notice shall be required during the existence and continuance of any Event of
Default.

            SECTION 4.7 USE OF PROCEEDS.

            Borrower will use the proceeds of the Loans solely for the following
purposes and in the following order of application: (a) for payment of
transaction fees and expenses incurred in connection with the preparation,
filing and administration of the Bankruptcy Cases and the DIP Loan Documents, in
accordance with the Budget, (b) to pay interest, fees, and expenses under the
DIP Loan Documents in accordance with the terms thereof, (c) for operating

the Budget. In particular, Borrower shall be entitled to use proceeds of the
Loans to pay all fees and reasonable professional fees and expenses payable to
Agent and Highland hereunder (including without limitation legal, financial
advisors and consultants, appraisal, audit and valuation-related fees and
expenses), regardless of whether incurred prior to or after the Closing Date.
Except as otherwise provided in the Financing Order, in no event shall any
portion of the Loans be used to pay costs or expenses incurred in connection
with the investigation, commencement of, or prosecution or other action
regarding, or any objection, defense or counterclaim to, (a) any claims that are
adverse to the Prepetition Transaction Documents or any Liens securing the
Prepetition Obligations or against the Prepetition Agent, any Prepetition
Lender, any Prepetition Noteholder, or any of their agents, attorneys, advisors
or representatives, (b) any claims that are adverse to the DIP Loan Documents or
any Liens securing the Obligations or against the Agent, any DIP Lender, or any
of their agents, attorneys, advisors or representatives, or (c) to fund the
acquisitions, Capital Expenditures, capital leases, or other transactions of any
Credit Party that are not in the ordinary course of such Credit Party's business
other than as set forth in the Budget. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with
respect to the

                                       40

at such other times as are reasonably requested by Agent or the Required DIP
Lenders, Borrower will conduct a meeting of Agent and the DIP Lenders to discuss
the applicable fiscal period's results and the financial condition of the Credit
Parties at which shall be present a Financial Officer and such officers of the
Credit Parties as may be reasonably requested to attend by Agent or the Required
DIP Lenders, such request or requests to be made within a reasonable time prior
to the scheduled date of such meeting. Such meetings shall be held at a time and
place convenient to the DIP Lenders and to Borrower.

            SECTION 4.9 HAZARDOUS MATERIALS; REMEDIATION.

            Each Credit Party will provide Agent within thirty (30) days after
demand therefor with a bond, letter of credit or similar financial assurance
evidencing to the satisfaction of Agent that sufficient funds are available to
pay the cost of removing, treating and disposing of any Hazardous Materials or
Hazardous Materials Contamination and discharging any assessment which may be
established on any property as a result thereof, such demand to be made, if at
all, upon Agent's reasonable business determination that the failure to remove,
treat or dispose of any Hazardous Materials or Hazardous Materials
Contamination, or the failure to discharge any such assessment could reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

            SECTION 4.10 FURTHER ASSURANCES.

            Each Credit Party will, at their own cost and expense, cause to be
promptly and duly taken, executed, acknowledged and delivered all such further
acts, documents and assurances as may from time to time be necessary or as Agent
or the Required DIP Lenders may from time to time reasonably request in order to
carry out the intent and purposes of the DIP Loan Documents and the transactions
contemplated thereby, including all such actions to establish, preserve, protect
and perfect a first priority Lien (subject only to Permitted Liens) in favor of
Agent for the benefit of the DIP Lenders on the Collateral (including Collateral
acquired after the date hereof), including on any and all assets of each Credit
Party, whether now owned or hereafter acquired.

            SECTION 4.11 COOPERATION.

            Each Credit Party will cooperate with Agent and its financial
advisors in providing to Agent and such advisors such information as is
necessary in order to permit Agent and such advisors to evaluate the Budgets
delivered hereunder, and to prepare periodic reconciliations of the Credit
Parties' actual performance to their performance projected in such Budgets.

            SECTION 4.12 DEBT RATINGS.

            As soon as practicable and at its own expense, Borrower shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a rating of the Debt evidenced by the
DIP Loan Documents.

                                       41

            SECTION 4.13 BUDGET.

                     ACCOUNTS AND INVENTORY REPRESENTATIONS,
                      WARRANTIES, COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS

            To induce Agent and DIP Lenders to enter into this DIP Credit
Agreement and to make the Loans and other credit accommodations contemplated
hereby, Borrower hereby represents and warrants to Agent and each DIP Lender,
and further agrees with Agent and each DIP Lender, that:

            SECTION 6.1 ACCOUNTS AND ACCOUNT COLLECTIONS.

            (a) Each Credit Party shall notify Agent promptly of: (i) any
material delay in the performance by each Credit Party of any of its material
obligations to any Account Debtor or the assertion of any material claims,
offsets, defenses or counterclaims by any Account Debtor, or any material
disputes with Account Debtors, or any settlement, adjustment or compromise
thereof, (ii) all material adverse information known to any Credit Party
relating to changes in the financial condition of any Account Debtor and (iii)
any event or circumstance which, to any Credit Party's knowledge, would result
in any Account no longer constituting an Eligible Account. Each Credit Party
hereby agrees not to grant to any Account Debtor any credit, discount, allowance
or extension, or to enter into any agreement for any of the foregoing, without
Agent's consent, except in the ordinary course of business in accordance with
practices and policies previously disclosed in writing to Agent. So long as no
Event of Default exists or has occurred and is continuing, each Credit Party may
settle, adjust or compromise any claim, offset, counterclaim or dispute with any
Account Debtor. At any time that an Event of Default exists or has occurred and
is continuing, Agent shall, at its option, have the exclusive right to settle,
adjust or compromise any claim, offset, counterclaim or dispute with Account
Debtors of any Credit Party or grant any credits, discounts or allowances.

            (b) With respect to each Account: (i) the amounts shown on any
invoice delivered to Agent or schedule thereof delivered to Agent shall be true
and complete in all material respects, (ii) no payments shall be received
thereon except payments immediately delivered to Agent pursuant to the terms of
this DIP Credit Agreement or any applicable Security Document (to the extent so
required), (iii) there shall be no setoffs, deductions, contras, defenses,
counterclaims or disputes existing or asserted with respect thereto except as
reported to Agent in accordance with the terms of SECTION 6.1(a) of this DIP
Credit Agreement, and (iv) none of the transactions giving rise thereto will
violate any applicable laws or regulations, all documentation relating thereto
will be legally sufficient under such laws and regulations and all such
documentation will be legally enforceable in accordance with its terms.

            (c) Agent shall have the right at any time or times, in Agent's name
or in the name of a nominee of Agent, to verify the validity, amount or any
other matter relating to any Account or other Collateral, by mail, telephone,
e-mail, facsimile transmission or otherwise. To facilitate the exercise of the
right described in the immediately preceding sentence, each Credit Party hereby
agrees to provide Agent upon request the name and address of each Account Debtor
of each Credit Party.

            (d) At Agent's request, each Credit Party shall establish and
maintain, at its sole expense, blocked accounts or lockboxes and related blocked
accounts (in either case,

                                       47

<PAGE>

"BLOCKED ACCOUNTS"), as Agent may specify, with such banks as are acceptable to
Agent into which each Credit Party shall promptly deposit and direct their
respective Account Debtors to directly remit all payments on Accounts and all
payments constituting proceeds of Inventory or other Collateral in the identical
form in which such payments are made, whether by cash, check or other manner.
Each Credit Party shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to Agent Deposit
Account Control Agreements duly authorized, executed and delivered by
substantially all (as determined by Agent in its sole discretion) of the banks
where Blocked Accounts for the benefit of any Credit Party are maintained, and
by substantially all (as determined by Agent in its sole discretion) banks where
any other Deposit Accounts are from time to time maintained. At Agent's request,
each Credit Party shall also establish and maintain, at its sole expense, a
concentration account (the "CONCENTRATION ACCOUNT") with a bank acceptable to
Agent, which shall also be subject to a Deposit Account Control Agreement. The
Deposit Account Control Agreements executed with respect to each Blocked Account
shall provide, at Agent's discretion, either that the Concentration Account bank
shall, on a daily basis, sweep all funds in such Blocked Accounts to the
Concentration Account by reverse ACH transfer, or that the Blocked Account bank
shall initiate daily wire transfers of funds in such Blocked Account to the
Concentration Account. The Deposit Account Control Agreement executed with
respect to the Concentration Account shall provide that all funds in the
Concentration Account shall be swept daily to the Payment Account or such other
account as instructed by Agent. At Agent's request, each Credit Party shall
further execute and deliver such agreements and documents as Agent may require
in connection with such Blocked Accounts, Deposit Accounts, Concentration
Account and such Deposit Account Control Agreements. Without limiting the
provisions of SECTION 5.14, no Credit Party shall establish any Deposit Accounts
not existing as of the Closing Date, unless each Credit Party or its Guarantors
(as applicable) have complied in full with the provisions of this SECTION 6.1
with respect to such Deposit Accounts. Each Credit Party agrees that all
payments made to such Blocked Accounts, the Concentration Account or other funds
received and collected by Agent or any DIP Lender, whether in respect of the
Accounts, as proceeds of Inventory or other Collateral or otherwise shall be
treated as payments to Agent and DIP Lenders in respect of the Obligations and
therefore shall constitute the property of Agent and DIP Lenders to the extent
of the then outstanding Obligations.

            (e) For purposes of calculating the amount of the Loans available to
Borrower and interest on the Obligations, payments made to a Blocked Account or
the Concentration Account will be applied (conditional upon final collection) to
the Obligations on the Business Day of receipt by Agent of immediately available
funds in the Payment Account provided such payments and notice thereof are
received in accordance with Agent's usual and customary practices as in effect
from time to time and with sufficient time to credit the Loan Account on such
day, and if not, then on the next Business Day.

            (f) Each Credit Party and its directors, employees, agents, and
other Affiliates shall, acting as trustee for Agent, receive, as the property of
Agent, any monies, checks, notes, drafts or any other payment relating to and/or
proceeds of Accounts, Inventory or other Collateral which come into their
possession or under their control and immediately upon receipt thereof, shall
deposit or cause the same to be deposited in the Blocked Accounts or the
Concentration Account, or remit the same or cause the same to be remitted, in
kind, to Agent. In no event shall the same be commingled with each Credit
Party's own funds. Each Credit Party agrees to reimburse Agent on demand for any
amounts owed or paid to any bank at which a Blocked Account or the Concentration
Account is established or any other bank or Person

                                       48

<PAGE>

involved in the transfer of funds to or from the Blocked Accounts or the
Concentration Account arising out of Agent's payments to or indemnification of
such bank or Person.

            SECTION 6.2 INVENTORY.

            With respect to the Inventory: (i) Borrower shall at all times
maintain, and cause each of its Guarantors to maintain, records of Inventory
reasonably satisfactory to Agent, keeping correct and accurate records itemizing
and describing the kind, type, quality and quantity of Inventory, the cost
therefor and daily withdrawals therefrom and additions thereto; (ii) Borrower
shall conduct, and cause each of its Guarantors to conduct, a physical count of
the Inventory at least once each year but at any time or times as Agent may
request on or after an Event of Default, and promptly following such physical
inventory shall supply Agent with a report in the form and with such specificity
as may be reasonably satisfactory to Agent concerning such physical count; (iii)
upon Agent's request from time to time, permit a third party designated by Agent
to conduct physical counts and verifications of each Credit Party's Inventory on
a complete or spot basis, with reconciliations back to each Credit Party's
records, all at each Credit Party's expense; (iv) upon Agent's request from time
to time, which request will be made on at least a calendar quarterly basis, each
Credit Party shall provide access to the Inventory to Agent's Inventory
appraisal firm; (v) each Credit Party shall not sell Inventory to any customer
on approval, or any other basis which entitles the customer to return (except
for the right of customers for Inventory which is defective or non-conforming)
or may obligate any Credit Party to repurchase such Inventory (other than
customary warranties or guarantees); (vi) each Credit Party shall keep the
Inventory in good and marketable condition; and (vii) each Credit Party shall
not acquire or accept without prior written notice to Agent, any Inventory on
consignment or approval.

                                   ARTICLE 7
                              PERFORMANCE COVENANTS

            Each Credit Party agrees that, so long as any Credit Exposure

cumulative basis from the Petition Date through such date, at least 90% of the

such period.

COMMITMENT.

            Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of
Default, Agent may, and shall if requested by Required DIP Lenders (i) by notice
to Borrower suspend or terminate the Aggregate Commitment, in whole or in part
(and, if in part, such reduction shall be pro rata in accordance with each DIP
Lender's Commitment Percentage) and/or (ii) by notice to

                                       55
<PAGE>

Borrower declare the Obligations to be, and the Obligations shall thereupon
become, immediately due and payable without presentment, demand, protest or
other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by Borrower and
Borrower will pay the same, subject to the applicable Financing Order. Without
limiting the foregoing, following acceleration of the Obligations (or any
portion thereof), subject to the Bankruptcy Court's power to issue appropriate
orders under Section 105 of the Bankruptcy Code, the Agent shall have the
ability to exercise, or refrain from exercising, any and all rights available to
it pursuant to the DIP Loan Documents and applicable law; provided that prior to
the repayment in full of all Obligations in immediately available funds, and the
termination of the Aggregate Commitment, the Agent shall, subject to the
indemnification provisions and all other provisions set forth in ARTICLE 11
hereof, act, with respect to the Collateral, in the manner directed by the
Required DIP Lenders.

            SECTION 9.3 DEFAULT RATE OF INTEREST.

            Effective immediately upon the occurrence of an Event of Default and
for so long as the Event of Default continues, the Loans and other Obligations
shall bear interest at rates that are two percent (2.0%) per annum in excess of
the rates otherwise payable under this DIP Credit Agreement.

            SECTION 9.4 SETOFF RIGHTS.

            During the continuance of any Event of Default, each DIP Lender is
hereby authorized by Borrower at any time or from time to time, with reasonably
prompt subsequent notice to Borrower (any prior or contemporaneous notice being
hereby expressly waived) to set off and to appropriate and to apply any and all
(A) balances held by such DIP Lender at any of its offices for the account of
Borrower or any Guarantors (regardless of whether such balances are then due to
Borrower or such Guarantors), and (B) other property at any time held or owing
by such DIP Lender to or for the credit or for Borrower's account or any
Guarantors, against and on account of any of the Obligations; except that no DIP
Lender shall exercise any such right without the prior written consent of Agent.
Any DIP Lender exercising a right to set off shall, in a manner which gives full
effect to the order of application of proceeds set forth in SECTION 9.6,
purchase for cash (and the other DIP Lenders shall sell) interests in each of
such other DIP Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Obligations as would be necessary
to cause all DIP Lenders to share the amount so set off with each other DIP
Lender in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Share of the Obligations.
Each Credit Party agrees, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that any DIP
Lender may exercise its right to set off with respect to the Obligations as
provided in this SECTION 9.4.

            SECTION 9.5 APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS.

            Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this DIP
Credit Agreement, subject to the applicable Financing Order, (a) Borrower
irrevocably waives the right to direct the application of any and all payments
at any time or times received by Agent from or on behalf of Borrower or any
Guarantor of all or any part of the Obligations, and Agent shall have the
continuing and exclusive right to apply and to reapply any and all payments
received at any time or times against the Obligations in such manner as Agent
may deem advisable notwithstanding any previous application by Agent or DIP
Lenders (provided that as among the Agent and the DIP Lenders, for so long as no
Event of Default exists, all accrued and unpaid interest, to the

                                       56
<PAGE>

extent due and payable in cash hereunder, shall be satisfied with payments made
by Borrower to the Agent, prior to the satisfaction of any principal
Obligations) and (b) the proceeds of any sale of, or other realization upon, all
or any part of the Collateral and all payments and distributions made by any
Credit Party with respect to the Obligations, shall be applied (subject to the
Reinvestment Reserve absent an Event of Default): first, to all fees, costs,
indemnities and expenses incurred by or owing to Agent, with respect to this DIP
Credit Agreement, the other DIP Loan Documents or the Collateral; second, to all
fees, costs, indemnities and expenses incurred by or owing to any DIP Lender
with respect to this DIP Credit Agreement, the other DIP Loan Documents, or the
Collateral, third, to accrued and unpaid interest on the Obligations (including
any interest which but for the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, would have
accrued on such amounts), fourth, to the principal amount of the Obligations
outstanding; and fifth, to any other indebtedness or obligations of Borrower
owing to Agent, any DIP Lender or any Designated DIP Lender Affiliate under the
DIP Loan Documents or with respect to Ancillary Services, including without
limitation fees, costs, indemnities and expenses thereunder. Any balance
remaining shall be delivered to whomever may be lawfully entitled to receive
such balance or as a court of competent jurisdiction may direct.

                EXPENSES, INDEMNITY, TAXES AND RIGHT TO PERFORM

            SECTION 10.1 EXPENSES.

            Each Credit Party jointly and severally hereby agrees to promptly
pay within two business day's of receipt of an invoice therefor (except where
subject to a reasonable dispute) (i) all reasonable costs and expenses of Agent

expenses of counsel to, and independent appraisers and consultants retained by
Agent or Highland including, without limitation, Haynes and Boone, LLP, Hahn,
Loeser & Parks LLP, and Barrier Advisors, L.P. in connection with the
examination, review, due diligence investigation (including, without limitation,
environmental due diligence investigation), documentation, negotiation, closing
and syndication of the transactions contemplated by the DIP Loan Documents, in
connection with the performance by Agent and such holders of their respective
rights and remedies under the DIP Loan Documents and in connection with the
continued administration of the DIP Loan Documents including any amendments,
modifications, consents and waivers to and/or under any and all DIP Loan
Documents, (ii) without limitation of the preceding CLAUSE (i), all costs and
expenses of Agent, Highland or their designee in connection with the creation,
perfection and maintenance of Liens pursuant to the DIP Loan Documents,
including title investigations, (iii) without limitation of the preceding CLAUSE
(i), expenses of Agent, Highland, or their designee in connection with the
Bankruptcy Cases (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses incurred in
connection with any action to lift the automatic stay of Section 362 of the
Bankruptcy Code, any other action or participation by Agent, Highland or their
designee or any such holder in the Bankruptcy Cases, or any other action or
participation by Agent, Highland or their designee in a suit or proceeding
brought in a venue other than the Bankruptcy Court, or any defense or
participation by Agent, Highland or their designee or any such holder) with
respect to any DIP Lender liability or other actions in the Bankruptcy Cases
involving Agent, Highland or their designee or any such holder), (iv) without
limitation of the preceding CLAUSE (i), expenses of Agent, Highland or their
designee in connection with protecting, storing, insuring, handling, maintaining
or selling any Collateral and in connection with any workout, collection,
bankruptcy, insolvency and other

                                       57
<PAGE>

enforcement proceedings under any and all of the DIP Loan Documents, and (v) all
costs and expenses incurred by DIP Lenders in connection with any workout,
collection, bankruptcy, insolvency and other enforcement proceedings under any
and all DIP Loan Documents.

            SECTION 10.2 INDEMNITY.

            Each Credit Party jointly and severally hereby agrees to indemnify,
pay and hold harmless Agent, Highland, and DIP Lenders and the officers,
directors, employees, agents, and counsel of Agent, Highland, and DIP Lenders
(collectively called the "INDEMNITEES") from and against any and all
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
claims, costs, taxes, governmental assessments, expenses and disbursements of
any kind or nature whatsoever (including the fees and disbursements of counsel
for such Indemnitee) in connection with any investigative, administrative or
judicial proceeding, whether or not such Indemnitee shall be designated a party
thereto and including any such proceeding initiated by or on behalf of a Credit
Party, and the reasonable expenses of investigation by engineers, environmental
consultants and similar technical personnel and any commission, fee or
compensation claimed by any broker (other than any broker retained by Agent or
DIP Lenders) asserting any right to payment for the transactions contemplated
hereby, which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against such Indemnitee
as a result of or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or by
the other DIP Loan Documents (including (i)(A) as a direct or indirect result of
the presence on, under or about, or escape, seepage, leakage, spillage,
discharge, emission or Release or threatened Release from, any property now or
previously owned, leased or operated by Borrower or any Guarantor of any
Hazardous Materials or any Hazardous Materials Contamination, (B) arising out of
or relating to the offsite disposal of any materials generated or present on any
such property generated or disposed of by any Credit Party or (C) arising out of
or resulting from the environmental condition of any such property or the
applicability of any governmental requirements relating to Hazardous Materials,
whether or not occasioned wholly or in part by any condition, accident or event
caused by any act or omission of Borrower or any Guarantor, and (ii) proposed
and actual extensions of credit under this DIP Credit Agreement) and the use or
intended use of the proceeds of the Loans, except that no Credit Party shall
have any obligation hereunder to an Indemnitee with respect to any liability
resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee, as
determined in a final non-appealable judgment by a court of competent
jurisdiction. To the extent that the undertaking set forth in the immediately
preceding sentence may be unenforceable, Borrower shall contribute the maximum
portion which it is permitted to pay and satisfy under applicable law to the
payment and satisfaction of all such indemnified liabilities incurred by the
Indemnitees or any of them. If and to the extent the Committee obtains a final
judgment against the Agent and DIP Lenders in connection with a claim or cause
of action prosecuted by it pursuant to SECTION 10(a) of the Financing Order, or
to the extent the Committee receives a payment from the Agent and DIP Lenders in
settlement or compromise thereof, the foregoing indemnity shall not be
applicable; provided, however, that such indemnity shall be applicable to the
extent of Agent's and the DIP Lenders' fees, costs and expenses incurred in
connection with any such action that is resolved by settlement or compromise.
This indemnification obligation includes both statutory and common law strict
liability claims, as well as negligence, strict liability and all other claims
arising under Environmental Laws, the Comprehensive Environmental Response
Compensation and Liability Act and ambiguous state laws.

<PAGE>

            SECTION 10.3 TAXES.

            Each Credit Party jointly and severally agrees to pay all
governmental assessments, charges or taxes (except income or other similar taxes
imposed on Agent or DIP Lenders), including any interest or penalties thereon,
at any time payable or ruled to be payable in respect of the existence,
execution or delivery of this DIP Credit Agreement or the other DIP Loan
Documents and to indemnify and hold Agent and DIP Lenders harmless against
liability in connection with any such assessments, charges or taxes.

            SECTION 10.4 RIGHT TO PERFORM.

            If any Credit Party fails to perform any obligation hereunder or
under any other DIP Loan Document, Agent itself may, but shall not be obligated
to, cause such obligation to be performed at the Credit Parties' expense and
each Credit Party agrees to reimburse Agent therefor on demand. All amounts
owing hereunder or under any other DIP Loan Document may be satisfied in full,
subject to the provisions of SECTION 2.1(a)(ii), through the making of
Protective Advances.

                                     AGENT

            SECTION 11.1 APPOINTMENT AND AUTHORIZATION.

            Each DIP Lender hereby irrevocably ratifies Agent's prior entry
into, and appoints and authorizes Agent to enter into, each of the Security
Documents on its behalf and to take such actions as Agent on its behalf and to
exercise such powers under the DIP Loan Documents as are delegated to Agent by
the terms thereof, together with all such powers as are reasonably incidental
thereto. Except as otherwise expressly provided in SECTION 12.5 or by the terms
of the DIP Loan Documents, Agent is authorized and empowered to amend, modify,
or waive any provisions of this DIP Credit Agreement or the other DIP Loan
Documents on behalf of DIP Lenders. The provisions of this ARTICLE 11 are solely
for the benefit of Agent and DIP Lenders and neither Borrower nor any other
Credit Party shall have any rights as a third party beneficiary of any of the
provisions hereof. In performing its functions and duties under this DIP Credit
Agreement, Agent shall act solely as agent of DIP Lenders and does not assume
and shall not be deemed to have assumed any obligation toward or relationship of
agency or trust with or for Borrower or any other Credit Party. Agent may
perform any of its duties hereunder, or under the DIP Loan Documents, by or
through its agents, designees, or employees.

            SECTION 11.2 AGENT AND AFFILIATES.

            Agent shall have the same rights and powers under the DIP Loan
Documents as any other DIP Lender and may exercise or refrain from exercising
the same as though it were not Agent, and Agent and its Affiliates may lend
money to, invest in and generally engage in any kind of business with each
Credit Party or Affiliate of any Credit Party as if it were not Agent hereunder.

                                       59
<PAGE>

            SECTION 11.3 ACTION BY AGENT.

            The duties of Agent shall be mechanical and administrative in
nature. Agent shall not have by reason of this DIP Credit Agreement a fiduciary
relationship in respect of any DIP Lender. Nothing in this DIP Credit Agreement
or any of the DIP Loan Documents, express or implied, is intended to or shall be
construed to impose upon Agent any obligations in respect of this DIP Credit
Agreement or any of the DIP Loan Documents except as expressly set forth herein
or therein.

            SECTION 11.4 CONSULTATION WITH EXPERTS.

            Agent may consult with legal counsel, independent public accountants
and other experts selected by it and shall not be liable for any action taken or
omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the advice of such
counsel, accountants or experts.

            SECTION 11.5 LIABILITY OF AGENT.

            Neither Agent nor any of its directors, officers, agents or
employees shall be liable to any DIP Lender for any action taken or not taken by
it in connection with the DIP Loan Documents, except that Agent shall be liable
to the extent of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by
a court of competent jurisdiction. Neither Agent nor any of its directors,
officers, agents or employees shall be responsible for or have any duty to
ascertain, inquire into or verify (i) any statement, warranty or representation
made in connection with any DIP Loan Document or any borrowing hereunder; (ii)
the performance or observance of any of the covenants or agreements specified in
any DIP Loan Document; (iii) the satisfaction of any condition specified in any
DIP Loan Document, except receipt of items required to be delivered to Agent;
(iv) the validity, effectiveness, sufficiency or genuineness of any DIP Loan
Document, any Lien purported to be created or perfected thereby or any other
instrument or writing furnished in connection therewith; (v) the existence or
non-existence of any Default or Event of Default; or (vi) the financial
condition of any Credit Party. Agent shall not incur any liability by acting in
reliance upon any notice, consent, certificate, statement, or other writing
(which may be a bank wire, telex, facsimile or electronic transmission or
similar writing) believed by it to be genuine or to be signed by the proper
party or parties. Agent shall not be liable for any apportionment or
distribution of payments made by it in good faith and if any such apportionment
or distribution is subsequently determined to have been made in error the sole
recourse of any DIP Lender to whom payment was due but not made, shall be to
recover from other DIP Lenders any payment in excess of the amount to which they
are determined to be entitled (and such other DIP Lenders hereby agree to return
to such DIP Lender any such erroneous payments received by them).

            SECTION 11.6 INDEMNIFICATION.

            Each DIP Lender shall, in accordance with its Pro Rata Share,
indemnify Agent (to the extent not reimbursed pursuant to SECTIONS 10.1 or 10.2)
against any cost, expense (including counsel fees and disbursements), claim,
demand, action, loss or liability (except such as result from Agent's gross
negligence or willful misconduct as determined in a non-appealable judgment by a
court of competent jurisdiction) that Agent may suffer or incur in connection
with the DIP Loan Documents or any action taken or omitted by Agent hereunder or
thereunder. If

                                       60
<PAGE>

any indemnity furnished to Agent for any purpose shall, in the opinion of Agent,
be insufficient or become impaired, Agent may call for additional indemnity and
cease, or not commence, to do the acts indemnified against even if so directed
by Required DIP Lenders, or such other portion of the DIP Lenders as shall be
prescribed by this DIP Credit Agreement, until such additional indemnity is
furnished. The obligations of DIP Lenders under this SECTION 11.6 shall survive
the payment in full of the Obligations, any Bankruptcy Cases, and the
termination of this DIP Credit Agreement.

            SECTION 11.7 RIGHT TO REQUEST AND ACT ON INSTRUCTIONS.

            Agent may at any time request instructions from DIP Lenders with
respect to any actions or approvals which by the terms of this DIP Credit
Agreement or of any of the DIP Loan Documents Agent is permitted or desires to
take or to grant, and if such instructions are promptly requested, Agent shall
be absolutely entitled to refrain from taking any action or to withhold any
approval and shall not be under any liability whatsoever to any Person for
refraining from any action or withholding any approval under any of the DIP Loan
Documents until it shall have received such instructions from Required DIP
Lenders or all or such other portion of the DIP Lenders as shall be prescribed
by this DIP Credit Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, no DIP Lender
shall have any right of action whatsoever against Agent as a result of Agent
acting or refraining from acting under this DIP Credit Agreement or any of the
other DIP Loan Documents in accordance with the instructions of Required DIP
Lenders or such other portion of DIP Lenders and, notwithstanding the
instructions of Required DIP Lenders or such other portion of DIP Lenders, Agent
shall have no obligation to take any action if it believes, in good faith, that
such action exposes Agent to any liability for which it has not received
satisfactory indemnification in accordance with the provisions of SECTION 11.6.

            SECTION 11.8 CREDIT DECISION.

            Each DIP Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without
reliance upon Agent or any other DIP Lender, and based on such documents and
information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and
decision to enter into this DIP Credit Agreement. Each DIP Lender also
acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon Agent or any
other DIP Lender, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem
appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or
not taking any action under the DIP Loan Documents.

            SECTION 11.9 COLLATERAL MATTERS.

            DIP Lenders irrevocably authorize Agent, at its option and in its
discretion, to release any Lien granted to or held by Agent under any Security
Document (i) upon termination of the Aggregate Commitment and payment in full of
all Obligations (other than contingent indemnification claims which have not
been asserted), or (ii) constituting property sold or to be sold or disposed of
as part of or in connection with any disposition permitted under any DIP Loan
Document (it being understood and agreed that Agent may conclusively rely
without further inquiry on a certificate of a Responsible Officer as to the sale
or other disposition of property being made in full compliance with the
provisions of the DIP Loan Documents). Upon request by Agent at any time, DIP
Lenders will confirm in writing Agent's authority to release particular types or
items of Collateral pursuant to this SECTION 11.9.

                                       61
<PAGE>

            SECTION 11.10 AGENCY FOR PERFECTION.

            Agent and each DIP Lender hereby appoint each other DIP Lender as
agent for the purpose of perfecting Agent's security interest in assets which,
in accordance with the Uniform Commercial Code in any applicable jurisdiction,
can be perfected by possession or control. Should any DIP Lender (other than
Agent) obtain possession or control of any such assets, such DIP Lender shall
notify Agent thereof, and, promptly upon Agent's request therefore, shall
deliver such assets to Agent or in accordance with Agent's instructions or
transfer control to Agent in accordance with Agent's instructions. Each DIP
Lender agrees that it will not have any right individually to enforce or seek to
enforce any Security Document or to realize upon any Collateral for the Loans
unless instructed to do so by Agent, it being understood and agreed that such
rights and remedies may be exercised only by Agent.

            SECTION 11.11 NOTICE OF DEFAULT.

            Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the
occurrence of any Default or Event of Default except with respect to defaults in
the payment of principal, interest and fees required to be paid to Agent for the
account of DIP Lenders, unless Agent shall have received written notice from a
DIP Lender or Borrower referring to this DIP Credit Agreement, describing such
Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a "notice of
default". Agent will notify each DIP Lender of its receipt of any such notice.
Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as
may be requested by Required DIP Lenders, or such other portion of the DIP
Lenders as shall be prescribed by this DIP Credit Agreement, in accordance with
the terms hereof. Unless and until Agent has received any such request, Agent
may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking
such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem
advisable or in the best interests of DIP Lenders.

            SECTION 11.12 SUCCESSOR AGENT.

            Agent may resign at any time by giving 30 days' written notice
thereof to the DIP Lenders and Borrower. Upon any such resignation, Required DIP
Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor Agent. If no successor Agent
shall have been so appointed by Required DIP Lenders, and shall have accepted
such appointment, within thirty (30) days after the retiring Agent gives notice
of resignation, then the retiring Agent may, on behalf of DIP Lenders, appoint a
successor Agent, which shall be a financial institution organized or licensed
under the laws of the United States of America or of any State thereof. Upon the
acceptance of its appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, such
successor Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights
and duties of the retiring Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be discharged
from its duties and obligations hereunder. After any retiring Agent's
resignation hereunder as Agent, the provisions of this Article shall inure to
its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was
Agent.

            SECTION 11.13 DISBURSEMENTS OF LOANS; PAYMENT.

            (a) Loan Advances, Payments and Settlements; Interest and Fee
Payments.

            (i) Agent shall have the right, on behalf of DIP Lenders, to
disburse funds to Borrower for all Loans requested by Borrower pursuant to the
terms of this DIP Credit Agreement. Absent the prior receipt by Agent of a
written notice from any DIP Lender pursuant to which such DIP Lender notifies
Agent that such DIP Lender shall cease making Loans (whether due to the
existence of a Default or Event of Default or otherwise), Agent shall be
conclusively entitled to assume, for purposes of the preceding sentence, that
each DIP Lender will fund its Pro Rata Share of all Loans requested by Borrower.
Each DIP Lender shall reimburse Agent on demand, in accordance with the
provisions of the immediately following paragraph, for all funds disbursed on
its behalf by Agent pursuant to the preceding sentence, or if Agent so requests,
each DIP Lender will remit to Agent its Pro Rata Share of any Loan before Agent
disburses the same to Borrower. If Agent elects to require that each DIP Lender
make funds available to Agent, prior to a disbursement by Agent to Borrower,
Agent shall advise each DIP Lender by telephone, facsimile or e-mail of the
amount of such DIP Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Loan requested by Borrower no
later than noon (Central time) on the date of funding of such Loan, and each
such DIP Lender shall pay Agent on such date such DIP Lender's Pro Rata Share of
such requested Loan, in same day funds, by wire transfer to the Payment Account,
or such other account as may be identified in writing by Agent to DIP Lenders
from time to time. If any DIP Lender fails to pay the amount of its Pro Rata
Share within one (1) Business Day after Agent's demand, Agent shall promptly
notify Borrower, and Borrower shall repay such amount to Agent within two (2)
Business Days. Any repayment required pursuant to this SECTION 11.13 shall be
without premium or penalty. Nothing in this SECTION 11.13 or elsewhere in this
DIP Credit Agreement or the other DIP Loan Documents shall be deemed to require
Agent to advance funds on behalf of any DIP Lender or to relieve any DIP Lender
from its obligation to fulfill its commitments hereunder or to prejudice any
rights that Agent or Borrower may have against any DIP Lender as a result of any
default by such DIP Lender hereunder.

            (ii) Upon any DIP Lender's request from time to time (each such day
being a "SETTLEMENT DATE"), Agent will advise each DIP Lender by telephone,
facsimile or e-mail of the amount of each such DIP Lender's Pro Rata Share of
the Loan balance (including any Protective Advances) as of the close of business
of the Business Day immediately preceding. In the event that payments are
necessary to adjust the amount of such DIP Lender's actual Pro Rata Share of the
Loan balance to such DIP Lender's required Pro Rata Share of the Loan balance as
of any Settlement Date, the party from which such payment is due (i) shall be
deemed, irrevocably and unconditionally, to have purchased, without recourse or
warranty, an undivided interest and participation in the Loans sufficient to
equate such DIP Lender's actual Pro Rata Share of the Loan balance as of such
Settlement Date with such DIP Lender's required Pro Rata Share of the Loans as
of such date and (ii) shall pay Agent, without setoff or discount, in same day
funds, by wire transfer to the Payment Account not later than noon (Central
time) on the Business Day following such date the full purchase price for such
interest and participation, equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the principal
amount of the Loans being purchased and sold. In the event settlement shall not
have occurred by the date and time specified in the immediately preceding
sentence, interest shall accrue on the unsettled amount at the Federal Funds
Rate, for

                                       63
<PAGE>

the first three (3) days following the scheduled date of settlement, and
thereafter at the Prime Rate plus the Prime Rate Margin.

            (iii) Upon receipt, Agent shall advise each DIP Lender by telephone,
facsimile or e-mail of the amount of such DIP Lender's Pro Rata Share of
principal, interest and fees paid for the benefit of DIP Lenders with respect to
each applicable Loan, to the extent of such DIP Lender's credit exposure with
respect thereto, and shall make payment to such DIP Lender not later than noon
(Central time) on the Business Day following the date of receipt of such amounts
in accordance with wire instructions delivered by such DIP Lender to Agent, as
the same may be modified from time to time by written notice to Agent; provided
that, in the case such DIP Lender is a Defaulted DIP Lender, Agent shall be
entitled to set off the funding short-fall against that Defaulted DIP Lender's
respective share of all payments received from Borrower.

            (iv) The provisions of this SECTION 11.13(a) shall be deemed to be
binding upon Agent and DIP Lenders notwithstanding the occurrence of any Default
or Event of Default, or any insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding pertaining to
Borrower or any other Credit Party.

            (b) Return of Payments.

            (i) If Agent pays an amount to a DIP Lender under this DIP Credit
Agreement in the belief or expectation that a related payment has been or will
be received by Agent from Borrower or any Guarantor and such related payment is
not received by Agent, then Agent will be entitled to recover such amount from
such DIP Lender on demand without setoff, counterclaim or deduction of any kind,
together with interest accruing on a daily basis at the Federal Funds Rate.

            (ii) If Agent determines at any time that any amount received by
Agent under this DIP Credit Agreement must be returned to Borrower or paid to
any other Person pursuant to any insolvency law or otherwise, then,
notwithstanding any other term or condition of this DIP Credit Agreement or any
other DIP Loan Document, Agent will not be required to distribute any portion
thereof to any DIP Lender. In addition, each DIP Lender will repay to Agent on
demand any portion of such amount that Agent has distributed to such DIP Lender,
together with interest at such rate, if any, as Agent is required to pay to
Borrower or such other Person, without setoff, counterclaim or deduction of any
kind.

            (c) Defaulted DIP Lenders. The failure of any Defaulted DIP Lender
to make any Loan, or any payment required by it hereunder shall not relieve any
other DIP Lender of its obligations to make such Loan or payment, but neither
any DIP Lender nor Agent shall be responsible for the failure of any Defaulted
DIP Lender to make a Loan, or make any other payment required hereunder.
Notwithstanding anything set forth herein to the contrary, at the election of
Agent, a Defaulted DIP Lender shall not have any voting or consent rights under
or with respect to any DIP Loan Document or constitute a "DIP Lender" (or be
included in the calculation of "Required DIP Lenders" hereunder) for any voting
or consent rights under or with respect to any DIP Loan Document. At Borrower's
request, Agent or a Person reasonably acceptable to Agent shall have the right
with Agent's consent and in Agent's sole discretion (but shall have no
obligation) to purchase from any Defaulted DIP Lender, and each Defaulted DIP
Lender agrees that it shall, at Agent's request, sell and assign to Agent or
such Person, all of the lending commitments and commitment interests of that
Defaulted DIP Lender for an amount

                                       64
<PAGE>

equal to the principal balance of all Loans held by such Defaulted DIP Lender
and all accrued interest and fees with respect thereto through the date of sale,
such purchase and sale to be consummated pursuant to an executed Assignment
Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE 12
                                    GUARANTY

            Each Guarantor hereby absolutely and unconditionally guarantees, as
a guarantee of payment and not merely as a guarantee of collection, prompt
payment when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise,
and at all times thereafter, of any and all existing and future indebtedness and
liabilities of every kind, nature and character, direct or indirect, absolute or
contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, voluntary or involuntary, of Borrower to
Agent and the DIP Lenders arising under this DIP Credit Agreement and all
instruments, agreements and other documents of every kind and nature now or
hereafter executed in connection with this DIP Credit Agreement (including all
renewals, extensions and modifications thereof and all costs, reasonable
attorneys' fees and expenses incurred by Agent or any DIP Lender in connection
with the collection or enforcement thereof) (collectively, the "GUARANTEED
OBLIGATIONS"). Agent's and the DIP Lenders' books and records showing the amount
of the Guaranteed Obligations shall be admissible in evidence in any action or
proceeding, and shall, absent manifest error, be binding upon each Guarantor and
conclusive for the purpose of establishing the amount of the Guaranteed
Obligations. This Guaranty shall not be affected by the genuineness, validity,
regularity or enforceability of the Guaranteed Obligations or any instrument or
agreement evidencing any Guaranteed Obligations, or by the existence, validity,
enforceability, perfection, or extent of any collateral therefor, or by any fact
or circumstance relating to the Guaranteed Obligations which might otherwise
constitute a defense to the obligations of the Guarantors hereunder. This
Guaranty is a continuing and irrevocable guaranty of all Guaranteed Obligations
now or hereafter existing and shall remain in full force and effect until all
Guaranteed Obligations and any other amounts payable under this Guaranty are
indefeasibly paid and performed in full and any commitments of the DIP Lenders
or facilities provided by the DIP Lenders with respect to the Guaranteed
Obligations are terminated. The obligations of each Guarantor hereunder are
those of primary obligor, and not merely as surety, and are independent of the
Guaranteed Obligations. Each Guarantor waives diligence by Agent or any DIP
Lender and action on delinquency in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations or any
part thereof, including, without limitation any provisions of law requiring
Agent or any DIP Lender to exhaust any right or remedy or to take any action
against Borrower, any other guarantor or any other person, entity or property
before enforcing this Guaranty against the Guarantors. Each Guarantor waives
notice of the acceptance of this Guaranty and of the extension or continuation
of the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof. Each Guarantor further waives
presentment, protest, notice, dishonor or default, demand for payment and any
other notices to which any Guarantor might otherwise be entitled.

            No Guarantor shall exercise any right of subrogation, contribution
or similar rights with respect to any payments it makes hereunder until all of
the Guaranteed Obligations and any amounts payable hereunder are indefeasibly
paid and performed in full and any commitments of the DIP Lenders or facilities
provided by the DIP Lenders with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations are
terminated. If any amounts are paid to any Guarantor in violation of

                                       65
<PAGE>

the foregoing limitation, then such amounts shall be held in trust for the
benefit of Agent and the DIP Lenders and shall forthwith be paid to Agent to
reduce the amount of the Guaranteed Obligations, whether matured or unmatured.

            Each Guarantor agrees that Agent and the DIP Lenders may, at any
time and from time to time, and without notice to the Guarantors, make any
agreement with Borrower or with any other person or entity liable on any of the
Guaranteed Obligations or providing collateral as security for the Guaranteed
Obligations, for the extension, renewal, payment, compromise, discharge or
release of the Guaranteed Obligations or any collateral (in whole or in part),
or for any modification or amendment of the terms thereof or of any instrument
or agreement evidencing the Guaranteed Obligations or the provision of
collateral, all without in any way impairing, releasing, discharging or
otherwise affecting the obligations of any Guarantor hereunder. Each Guarantor
waives any defense arising by reason of any disability or other defense of any
Borrower or any other guarantor and waives the benefit of any statute of
limitations affecting the liability of the Guarantors hereunder. Each Guarantor
waives any right to enforce any remedy which Agent or the DIP Lenders now have
or may hereafter have against Borrower and waives any benefit of and any right
to participate in any security now or hereafter held by Agent or any DIP Lender.
Further, each Guarantor consents to the taking of, or failure to take, any
action which might in any manner or to any extent vary the risks of the
Guarantors hereunder or which, but for this provision, might operate as a
discharge of the Guarantors.

            Each Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that it has the sole
responsibility for, and has adequate means of, obtaining from Borrower such
information concerning the financial condition, business and operations of
Borrower as such Guarantor requires, and that neither Agent nor any of the DIP
Lenders have any duty, and each such Guarantor is not relying on Agent or any
DIP Lender at any time, to disclose to the Guarantors any information relating
to the business, operations or financial condition of Borrower.

                                   ARTICLE 13
                                 MISCELLANEOUS

            SECTION 13.1 SURVIVAL.

            All agreements, representations and warranties made herein and in
every other DIP Loan Document shall survive the execution and delivery of this
DIP Credit Agreement and the other DIP Loan Documents. The indemnities and
agreements set forth in ARTICLE 6 and ARTICLE 10 shall survive the payment of
the Obligations and any termination of this DIP Credit Agreement.

            SECTION 13.2 NO WAIVERS.

            No failure or delay by Agent or any DIP Lender in exercising any
right, power or privilege under any DIP Loan Document shall operate as a waiver
thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.
The rights and remedies herein and therein provided shall be cumulative and not
exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law.

            SECTION 13.3 NOTICES.

            All notices, requests and other communications to any party
hereunder shall be in writing (including prepaid overnight courier, facsimile
transmission, similar writing, or in the case of communications among Agent and
DIP Lenders only, e-mail) and shall be given to such party at its address,
facsimile number or e-mail address set forth on ANNEX C attached hereto (or, in
the case of any such DIP Lender who becomes a DIP Lender after the date hereof,
in an Assignment Agreement or in a notice delivered to Borrower and Agent by the
assignee DIP Lender forthwith upon such assignment) or at such other address,
facsimile number or e-mail address as such party may hereafter specify for the
purpose by notice to Agent and Borrower. Each such notice, request or other
communication shall be effective (i) if given by facsimile or e-mail, when such
notice is transmitted to the facsimile number or e-mail address specified by
this Section or (ii) if given by mail, prepaid overnight courier or any other
means, when received at the applicable address specified by this Section. Notice
required to be sent hereunder to the Committee shall be sent by e-mail or
facsimile.

            SECTION 13.4 SEVERABILITY.

            In case any provision of or obligation under this DIP Credit
Agreement or any other DIP Loan Document shall be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the validity, legality and enforceability of
the remaining provisions or obligations, or of such provision or obligation in
any other jurisdiction, shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

            SECTION 13.5 AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS.

            Any provision of this DIP Credit Agreement or the Notes may be
amended or waived if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is
signed by Borrower and, prior to the repayment in full of all Obligations in
immediately available funds and termination of the Aggregate Commitment, the
Required DIP Lenders; provided that no such amendment or waiver shall, unless
signed by all the DIP Lenders: (i) increase any DIP Lender's Commitment Amount,
(ii) reduce the principal of, rate of interest on or any fees with respect to
the Obligations; (iii) postpone the date fixed for any payment (other than a
prepayment pursuant to SECTION 2.3) of principal of any Loan, or of interest
thereon, or any fees hereunder with respect thereto or for any termination of
any commitment; (iv) change the definition of the term Required DIP Lenders or
the percentage of DIP Lenders which shall be required for DIP Lenders to take
any action hereunder; (v) amend or waive this SECTION 13.5 or the definitions of
the terms used in this SECTION 13.5 insofar as the definitions affect the
substance of this SECTION 13.5; (vi) consent to the assignment, delegation or
other transfer by any Credit Party of any of its rights and obligations under
any DIP Loan Document; (viii) amend the definition of the term "Borrowing Base",
except as expressly provided herein; (ix) amend the provisions of SECTION 9.6;
(x) release all or substantially all of the Collateral (provided that the
consent of Required DIP Lenders only will be necessary to approve a sale that
results in the repayment in full of all Obligations in immediately available
funds, and the termination of the Aggregate Commitment); or (xi) amend or waive
any provision of any DIP Loan Document that expressly requires the consent and
approval of "the DIP Lenders" or "all DIP Lenders."

                                       67

            Borrower will provide copies of all amendments and waivers to the
Committee, promptly following the execution thereof.

            SECTION 13.6 ASSIGNMENTS; PARTICIPATIONS.

            (a) Assignments.

            (i) Any DIP Lender may at any time, following not less than three
(3) Business Days' prior written notice to Agent, assign to one or more Persons
(any such Person, an "ASSIGNEE") all or any portion of such DIP Lender's Loans
and interest in the Aggregate Commitment with the prior written consent of Agent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed and shall not be
required for an assignment by a DIP Lender to another DIP Lender or to an
Affiliate of a DIP Lender), provided however, that any such Assignee shall be
bound by and subject to the terms and conditions of the Lockup and Voting
Agreement as though an original signatory thereto and each such assignment of
any DIP Lender's Loans shall specifically provide that the Assignee shall be
bound by and subject to the terms and conditions of the Lockup and Voting
Agreement as a condition to the effectiveness of any such assignment. Except as
Agent may otherwise agree, any such assignment shall be in a minimum aggregate
amount equal to $1,000,000 or, if less, the assignor's entire interests in the
Aggregate Commitment and outstanding Loans. Borrower and Agent shall be entitled
to continue to deal solely and directly with such DIP Lender in connection with
the interests so assigned to an Assignee until Agent shall have received and
accepted an effective Assignment Agreement executed, delivered and fully
completed by the applicable parties thereto and, unless such Assignee is a DIP
Lender or an Affiliate of a DIP Lender, a processing fee of $3,500. Any
attempted assignment not made in accordance with this SECTION 13.6(a) shall be
treated as the sale of a participation under SECTION 13.6(b).

            (ii) From and after the date on which the conditions described above
have been met, (i) such Assignee shall be deemed automatically to have become a
party hereto and to the Lockup and Voting Agreement and, to the extent that
rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned to such Assignee pursuant to
such Assignment Agreement, shall have the rights and obligations of a DIP Lender
hereunder and (ii) the assigning DIP Lender, to the extent that rights and
obligations hereunder have been assigned by it pursuant to such Assignment
Agreement, shall be released from its rights (other than its indemnification
rights) and obligations hereunder. Upon the request of the Assignee (and, as
applicable, the assigning DIP Lender) pursuant to an effective Assignment
Agreement, Borrower shall execute and deliver to Agent for delivery to the
Assignee (and, as applicable, the assigning DIP Lender) a Note in the aggregate
principal amount of the Assignee's percentage interest in the Aggregate
Commitment (and, as applicable, a Note in the principal amount of that portion
of the Aggregate Commitment retained by the assigning DIP Lender). Upon receipt
by the assigning DIP Lender of such Note, the assigning DIP Lender shall return
to Borrower any prior Note held by it.

            (iii) Agent shall maintain at one of its offices a copy of each
Assignment Agreement delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the
names and addresses of each DIP Lender, and the commitments of, and principal
amount of the Loans owing to, such DIP Lender pursuant to the terms hereof. The
entries in such register shall be conclusive, and Borrower, Agent and DIP
Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded therein pursuant to the
terms hereof as a DIP Lender hereunder for all purposes of this DIP Credit

                                       68
<PAGE>

Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. Such register shall be
available for inspection by Borrower and any DIP Lender, at any reasonable time
upon reasonable prior notice to Agent.

            (iv) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this SECTION
13.6(a) or any other provision of this DIP Credit Agreement, any DIP Lender may
at any time assign all or any portion of its Loans and its Note as collateral
security to a Federal Reserve Bank or, as applicable, to such DIP Lender's
trustee for the benefit of its investors (but no such assignment shall release
any DIP Lender from any of its obligations hereunder).

            (b) Participations.

            Any DIP Lender may at any time sell to one or more Persons
participating interests in its Loans, commitments or other interests hereunder
(any such Person, a "PARTICIPANT"). In the event of a sale by a DIP Lender of a
participating interest to a Participant, (a) such DIP Lender's obligations
hereunder shall remain unchanged for all purposes, (b) Borrower and Agent shall
continue to deal solely and directly with such DIP Lender in connection with
such DIP Lender's rights and obligations hereunder and (c) all amounts payable
by Borrower shall be determined as if such DIP Lender had not sold such
participation and shall be paid directly to such DIP Lender. No Participant
shall have any direct or indirect voting rights hereunder except with respect to
any event described in SECTION 13.5 expressly requiring the unanimous vote of
all DIP Lenders or, as applicable, all affected DIP Lenders. Each DIP Lender
agrees to incorporate the requirements of the preceding sentence into each
participation agreement which such DIP Lender enters into with any Participant.
Borrower agrees that if amounts outstanding under this DIP Credit Agreement are
due and payable (as a result of acceleration or otherwise), each Participant
shall be deemed to have the right of set-off in respect of its participating
interest in amounts owing under this DIP Credit Agreement to the same extent as
if the amount of its participating interest were owing directly to it as a DIP
Lender under this DIP Credit Agreement; provided that such right of set-off
shall be subject to the obligation of each Participant to share with DIP
Lenders, and DIP Lenders agree to share with each Participant, as provided in
SECTION 9.5.

            SECTION 13.7 HEADINGS.

            Headings and captions used in the DIP Loan Documents (including the
Exhibits, Schedules and Annexes hereto and thereto) are included for convenience
of reference only and shall not be given any substantive effect.

            SECTION 13.8 CONFIDENTIALITY.

            In handling any confidential information of any Credit Party, Agent
and each DIP Lender shall exercise the same degree of care that it exercises
with respect to its own proprietary information of the same types to maintain
the confidentiality of any non-public information thereby received or received
pursuant to this DIP Credit Agreement, except that disclosure of such
information may be made (i) to agents, employees, Guarantors, Affiliates,
attorneys and advisors of such Person in connection with its present or
prospective business relations with the Credit Parties arising out of the DIP
Loan Documents, (ii) to prospective transferees or purchasers of any interest in
the Loans, provided that they have agreed to be bound by the

                                       69
<PAGE>

provision of this SECTION 13.8, (iii) as required by law, regulation, rule,
request or order, subpoena, judicial order or similar order and in connection
with any litigation and (iv) as may be required in connection with the
examination, audit or similar investigation of such Person. Confidential
information shall include all financial projections delivered by any Credit
Party pursuant to this DIP Credit Agreement and such other information
identified as confidential at the time provided to Agent and shall not include
information that either: (a) is in the public domain, or becomes part of the
public domain after disclosure to such Person through no fault of such Person,
or (b) is disclosed to such Person by a third party, provided Agent does not
have actual knowledge that such third party is prohibited from disclosing such
information.

            SECTION 13.9 GOVERNING LAW; SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION.

            THIS DIP CREDIT AGREEMENT, EACH NOTE AND EACH OTHER DIP LOAN
DOCUMENT TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE, AND SUBJECT TO THE BANKRUPTCY CODE, SHALL BE
GOVERNED BY, AND SHALL BE CONSTRUED AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF
THE STATE OF OHIO, WITHOUT REGARD TO CONFLICTS OF LAWS PRINCIPLES. EACH PARTY
HERETO, IN EACH CASE FOR ITSELF, ITS SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS, HEREBY (A)
IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE JURISDICTION OF THE BANKRUPTCY COURT AND AGREES AND
CONSENTS THAT SERVICE OF PROCESS MAY BE MADE UPON IT IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING

HAVE TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY LITIGATION ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION
WITH THE DIP LOAN DOCUMENTS AND THE OBLIGATIONS BROUGHT IN SUCH COURT, (C)
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY CLAIMS THAT ANY LITIGATION BROUGHT IN SUCH COURT HAS BEEN
BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM, (D) IRREVOCABLY CONSENTS TO THE SERVICE OF
PROCESS OUT OF THE COURT IN ANY SUCH LITIGATION BY THE MAILING OF COPIES THEREOF
BY CERTIFIED MAIL, RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED, POSTAGE PREPAID, AT ITS ADDRESS SET
FORTH HEREIN, AND (E) IRREVOCABLY AGREES THAT ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING AGAINST ANY
PARTY HERETO ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE DIP LOAN DOCUMENTS OR THE
OBLIGATIONS SHALL BE BROUGHT IN THE BANKRUPTCY COURT. IF (I) THE BANKRUPTCY
CASES ARE DISMISSED OR (II) THE BANKRUPTCY COURT ABSTAINS FROM HEARING, OR
REFUSES TO EXERCISE JURISDICTION OVER, ANY ACTIONS OR PROCEEDINGS ARISING IN
CONNECTION WITH THIS DIP CREDIT AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER DIP LOAN DOCUMENTS OR IN
ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH, OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE DEALINGS OF THE PARTIES
HERETO IN RESPECT OF THIS DIP CREDIT AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER DIP LOAN DOCUMENTS
OR THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED HERETO OR THERETO, THEN EACH CREDIT PARTY HEREBY
CONSENTS TO THE NON-EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF ANY STATE OR FEDERAL COURT LOCATED
WITHIN THE COUNTY OF MONTGOMERY, STATE OF OHIO AND IRREVOCABLY AGREES THAT,
SUBJECT TO AGENT'S ELECTION, ALL ACTIONS OR PROCEEDINGS ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS DIP

                                       70
<PAGE>

CREDIT AGREEMENT OR THE OTHER DIP LOAN DOCUMENTS SHALL BE LITIGATED IN SUCH
COURTS. EACH CREDIT PARTY EXPRESSLY SUBMITS AND CONSENTS TO THE JURISDICTION OF
THE AFORESAID COURTS AND WAIVES ANY DEFENSE OF FORUM NON CONVENIENS. EACH CREDIT
PARTY HEREBY WAIVES PERSONAL SERVICE OF ANY AND ALL PROCESS AND AGREES THAT ALL

            SECTION 13.10 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.

            (a) EACH CREDIT PARTY, AGENT AND THE DIP LENDERS HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE DIP LOAN DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED THEREBY AND AGREES THAT ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING SHALL BE
TRIED BEFORE A COURT AND NOT BEFORE A JURY.

            SECTION 13.11 COUNTERPARTS; INTEGRATION.

            This DIP Credit Agreement and the other DIP Loan Documents may be
signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with
the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same
instrument. THIS DIP CREDIT AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER DIP LOAN DOCUMENTS REPRESENT
THE FINAL AGREEMENT AMONG THE PARTIES AND MAY NOT BE CONTRADICTED BY EVIDENCE OF
PRIOR, CONTEMPORANEOUS, OR SUBSEQUENT ORAL AGREEMENTS OF THE PARTIES. THERE ARE
NO UNWRITTEN ORAL AGREEMENTS AMONG THE PARTIES.

            SECTION 13.12 USA PATRIOT ACT NOTICE.

            Each DIP Lender that is subject to the Act (as hereinafter defined)
and the Agent (for itself and not on behalf of any DIP Lender) hereby notifies
each of the Credit Parties that pursuant to the requirements of the USA Patriot
Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)) (the
"ACT"), each DIP Lender and the Agent is required to obtain, verify and record
information that identifies each Credit Party, which information includes the
name and address of each Credit Party and other information that will allow such
DIP Lender or the Agent, as applicable, to identify each Credit Party in
accordance with the Act.

hereby purchases and assumes from Assignor the interests set forth on the
schedule attached hereto (the "SCHEDULE"), in and to Assignor's rights and
obligations under the DIP Credit Agreement as of the effective date set forth on
the Schedule (the "EFFECTIVE DATE"). Such purchase and sale is made without
recourse, representation or warranty except as expressly set forth herein. On
the Effective Date, Assignee shall pay to Assignor an amount equal to the
aggregate amount assigned pursuant to the Schedule (exclusive of unfunded
portion of the Commitment) and Assignor shall pay to Assignee a closing fee (if
applicable) in respect of the transactions contemplated hereby in the amount
specified on the Schedule.

            2. Assignor (i) represents that as of the Effective Date, that it is
the legal and beneficial owner of the interests assigned hereunder free and
clear of any adverse claim, (ii) makes no other representation or warranty and
assumes no responsibility with respect to any statement, warranties or
representations made in or in connection with the DIP Credit Agreement or the
execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value
of the DIP Credit Agreement, any other DIP Loan Documents or any other
instrument or document furnished pursuant thereto; and (iii) makes no
representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to the
financial condition of any other Credit Party or any other Person or the
performance or observance by any Credit Party of its Obligations under the DIP
Credit Agreement or any other DIP Loan Documents or any other instrument or
document furnished pursuant thereto.

            3. Assignee (i) confirms that it has received a copy of the DIP
Credit Agreement and the other DIP Loan Documents, together with copies of the

documents and information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit
analysis and decision to enter into this Assignment Agreement; (ii) agrees that
it will, independently and without reliance upon Agent, Assignor or any other
DIP Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall deem
appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or
not taking action under the DIP Credit Agreement; (iii) appoints and authorizes
Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers
under the DIP Credit Agreement and the other DIP Loan Documents as are delegated
to Agent by the terms thereof, together with such powers as are reasonably

incidental thereto; (iv) agrees that it will perform in accordance with their
terms all obligations which by the terms of the DIP Credit Agreement are
required to be performed by it as a DIP Lender; (v) represents that on the date
of this Assignment Agreement it is not presently aware of any facts that would
cause it to make a claim under the DIP Credit Agreement; (vi) represents and
warrants that Assignee is not a foreign person (i.e., a person other than a

a foreign person, that it has delivered to Agent the documentation required to
be delivered to Agent by SECTION 13 below; and (vii) represents and warrants
that it has experience and expertise in the making or the purchasing of loans
such as the Loans, and that it has acquired the interests described herein for
its own account.

            4. Each of Assignor and Assignee represents and warrants to the
other party hereto that it has full power and authority to enter into this
Assignment Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder in accordance with
the provisions hereof, that this Assignment Agreement has been duly authorized,
executed and delivered by such party and that this Assignment Agreement
constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of such party, enforceable
against such party in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be
limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or
other similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and by general
principles of equity.

            5. Upon the effectiveness of this Assignment Agreement pursuant to
SECTION 13 below, (i) Agent shall register Assignee as a DIP Lender, pursuant to
the terms of the DIP Credit Agreement, (ii) Assignee shall be a party to the DIP
Credit Agreement and, to the extent provided in this Assignment Agreement, have

shall thereafter make all payments in respect of the interest assigned hereby
(including payments of principal, interest, fees and other amounts) to Assignee.
Assignor and Assignee shall make all appropriate adjustments in payments for
periods prior to the Effective Date by Agent or with respect to the making of
this assignment directly between themselves.

            6. Each of Assignor and Assignee hereby agrees from time to time,
upon request of the other such party hereto, to take such additional actions and
to execute and deliver such additional documents and instruments as such other
party may reasonably request to effect the transactions contemplated by, and to
carry out the intent of, this Assignment Agreement.

            7. Neither this Assignment Agreement nor any term hereof may be
changed, waived, discharged or terminated, except by an instrument in writing
signed by the party (including, if applicable, any party required to evidence
its consent to or acceptance of this Assignment Agreement) against whom
enforcement of such change, waiver, discharge or termination is sought.

            8. For the purposes hereof and for purposes of the DIP Credit
Agreement, the notice address of Assignee shall be as set forth on the Schedule.
Any notice or other communication herein required or permitted to be given shall
be in writing and delivered in accordance with the notice provisions of the DIP
Credit Agreement.

Agreement shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the

obligations, or of such provision or obligation in any other jurisdiction, shall
