ITEM 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement

(a) On December 16, 2004, EasyLink Services Corporation ("EasyLink" or the
"Company") and its wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries EasyLink Services USA,
Inc., Swift Telecommunications, Inc., and EasyLink Services International, Inc.
(EasyLink, together with these subsidiaries, the "Borrowers") entered into a
credit agreement and related documents with Wells Fargo Foothill, Inc.

On December 16, 2004, the Borrowers became obligated on a direct financial
obligation by receiving a term loan in the amount of $12 million under the
credit agreement. Of the $12 million proceeds of the term loan, approximately
$9.1 million was used to repay all of the Company's outstanding senior debt and
approximately $1.4 million will be used to repay the Company's convertible
subordinated debt at maturity during the first quarter of 2005. The balance of
the proceeds of the term loan, net of transaction costs, may be used for lawful
and permitted purposes.

Subject to the terms and conditions under the credit agreement, the Company may
also receive revolving credit advances and letters of credit. Revolving credit
advances may not exceed at any one time outstanding an amount equal to the
lesser of (i) $15 million less the aggregate undrawn amount of all outstanding
letters of credit, less the principal amount from time to time outstanding on
the term loan, or (ii) the borrowing base established under the credit agreement
less the aggregate undrawn amount of all outstanding letters of credit. The
borrowing base established under the credit agreement means, as of any date of
determination, the lowest of (i) 85% of the amount of eligible accounts, (ii) an
amount equal to Borrowers' collections with respect to accounts for the
immediately preceding 90 day period, and (iii) $3,000,000 ($7,500,000 subject to
satisfaction of specified conditions), all as reduced by any reserves imposed
under or pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement.

The term loan will bear interest at the per annum rate equal to Wells Fargo's
publicly announced "prime rate" plus 3.75%. Revolving credit advances will bear
interest at the per annum rate equal to Wells Fargo's publicly announced "prime
rate" plus 0.75%. The Borrowers may also elect to have revolving credit advances
bear interest based on the LIBOR rate determined by Wells Fargo. The interest
rate on the term loan and advances shall not be less than 4.5% per annum.

Borrowers shall pay a letter of credit fee on the undrawn amount of all
outstanding letters of credit equal to 3.50% per annum.

Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default under the
credit agreement, the outstanding revolving credit advances, term loan and
letters of credit bear interest or fees, as applicable, at the rate per annum
equal to 2% in excess of the rate otherwise in effect.

The term loan must be repaid in monthly payments of $200,000 over 60 months
commencing January 1, 2005. In addition, the Company must make mandatory
prepayments of the term loan in the following circumstances: (a) after delivery
of EasyLink's annual audited financial statements for each year commencing the
year ending December 31, 2005 in an aggregate amount equal to the lesser of (i)
$400,000 and (ii) 25% of the excess cash flow for the preceding fiscal year; (b)
upon certain sales or dispositions of assets of the Borrowers; and (c) upon the
receipt of certain extraordinary items in excess of $1 million, including
certain tax refunds, insurance proceeds and condemnation proceeds. The Company
must also make a mandatory prepayment of the term loan when the outstanding
principal amount of the revolving credit advances and the term loan plus the
undrawn amount of outstanding letters of credit exceeds the lowest of (a) $15
million, (b) 2.00 times trailing twelve months EBITDA, (c) 50% of the enterprise
valuation made pursuant to the credit agreement and (d) Borrowers' collections
with respect to accounts arising from transactions located in the United States
for the immediately preceding 90 day period.

                                       2
<PAGE>

The Borrowers may, at any time and from time to time, on and after January 1,
2006, prepay an amount up to $3,000,000 in the aggregate of the outstanding
principal amount of the term loan, without premium or penalty. In addition,
Borrowers have the option, at any time upon 30 days prior written notice to
Wells Fargo, to terminate the credit agreement by paying to Wells Fargo
Foothill, in cash, all obligations under the credit agreement (including certain
additional amounts to be held as cash collateral in the case of outstanding
letters of credit) in full.

The credit agreement imposes various conventional affirmative and negative
covenants, including limitations on indebtedness, liens, mergers, disposal of
assets, changes of control, distributions on the Company's capital stock and
investments. The Company must maintain the minimum EBITDA levels, and may not
incur capital expenditures in excess of the amounts, set forth in the credit
agreement.

The credit agreement contains customary events of default. The events of default
include payment defaults, covenant defaults, material inaccuracies in
representations and warranties, certain cross-defaults, bankruptcy and
liquidation proceedings, the failure of the security documents to create a valid
and perfected lien on the collateral securing the obligations under the credit
agreement and other customary defaults. Upon an event of default, the credit
agreement provides that, among other things, the outstanding obligations under
the credit agreement may be declared due and payable and Wells Fargo Foothill
may terminate any future obligations on its part under the credit agreement.

All obligations under the credit agreement are secured by all of the assets of
the Company and its direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries.

The respective forms of the credit agreement and security documents are attached
hereto as Exhibits 10.1 through 10.11, respectively, and are incorporated by
reference herein. The foregoing summary of the terms of the credit agreement and
security arrangements is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by
reference to the credit agreement and the security documents attached hereto as
exhibits.

The refinancing of the Company's existing senior debt and the consequent
elimination of previously capitalized interest will result in a gain before
income taxes of approximately $1 million to be recognized in the fourth quarter
of 2004. Interest on debt under the new credit agreement, however, will be
recognized as incurred resulting in increased interest expense for financial
reporting purposes in future periods.

This report may contain statements of a forward-looking nature relating to the
future events or the future financial results of EasyLink. Investors are
cautioned that such statements are only predictions and that actual events or
results may differ materially. In evaluating such statements, investors should
specifically consider the various factors which could cause actual events or
results to differ materially from those indicated from such forward-looking
statements. These inlcude: previous losses from operations; the ability to
service our indebtedness and maintain compliance with the financial covenants
imposed by our new credit facility; the risk of an increase in our interest
costs under the new credit facility due to an increase in the prime rate; the
ability to continue as a going concern being dependent upon the ability to
generate sufficient cash flow to meet our obligations on a timely basis, to
obtain additional financing or capital as may be required, and to maintain
profitable operations; the ability to attract additional customers or to expand
services sold to existing customers; the ability to successfully implement our
business strategy; significant competition; the risks inherent in integrating
the EasyLink business; and the risk of being delisted from NASDAQ. These and
other risks and uncertainties are described in more detail in the Company's
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

                                CREDIT AGREEMENT

                  THIS CREDIT AGREEMENT (this "Agreement"), is entered into as
of December 9, 2004, by and among, on the one hand, WELLS FARGO FOOTHILL, INC.,
a California corporation ("Lender"), and on the other hand, EASYLINK SERVICES
CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), and each of Parent's
Subsidiaries identified on the signature pages hereof (such Subsidiaries,
together with Parent, are referred to hereinafter each individually as a
"Borrower", and individually and collectively, jointly and severally, as the
"Borrowers").

                  The parties agree as follows:

1.       DEFINITIONS AND CONSTRUCTION.

         1.1 DEFINITIONS. Capitalized terms used in this Agreement shall have
the meanings specified therefor on Schedule 1.1.

         1.2 ACCOUNTING TERMS. All accounting terms not specifically defined
herein shall be construed in accordance with GAAP. When used herein, the term
"financial statements" shall include the notes and schedules thereto. Whenever
the term "Borrowers" or the term "Parent" is used in respect of a financial
covenant or a related definition, it shall be understood to mean Parent and its
Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis unless the context clearly requires
otherwise.

         1.3 CODE. Any terms used in this Agreement that are defined in the Code
shall be construed and defined as set forth in the Code unless otherwise defined
herein, provided, however, that to the extent that the Code is used to define
any term herein and such term is defined differently in different Articles of
the Code, the definition of such term contained in Article 9 shall govern.

         1.4 CONSTRUCTION. Unless the context of this Agreement or any other
Loan Document clearly requires otherwise, references to the plural include the
singular, references to the singular include the plural, the terms "includes"
and "including" are not limiting, and the term "or" has, except where otherwise
indicated, the inclusive meaning represented by the phrase "and/or." The words
"hereof," "herein," "hereby," "hereunder," and similar terms in this Agreement
or any other Loan Document refer to this Agreement or such other Loan Document,
as the case may be, as a whole and not to any particular provision of this
Agreement or such other Loan Document, as the case may be. Section, subsection,
clause, schedule, and exhibit references herein are to this Agreement unless
otherwise specified. Any reference in this Agreement or in the other Loan
Documents to any agreement, instrument, or document shall include all
alterations, amendments, changes, extensions, modifications, renewals,
replacements, substitutions, joinders, and supplements, thereto and thereof, as
applicable (subject to any restrictions on such alterations, amendments,
changes, extensions, modifications, renewals, replacements, substitutions,
joinders, and supplements set forth herein). Any reference herein to the
satisfaction or repayment in full of the Obligations shall mean the repayment in
full in cash (or cash collateralization in accordance with the terms hereof) of
all Obligations other than contingent indemnification Obligations and other than
any Bank Product Obligations that, at such time, are allowed by the applicable
Bank Product Provider to remain outstanding and are not required to be repaid or
cash collateralized pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement. Any reference
herein to any Person shall be construed to include such Person's successors and
assigns. Any requirement of a writing contained herein or in the other Loan
Documents shall be satisfied by the transmission of a Record and any Record
transmitted shall constitute a representation and warranty as to the accuracy
and completeness of the information contained therein.

to this Agreement shall be deemed incorporated herein by reference.

2. LOAN AND TERMS OF PAYMENT.

         2.1 REVOLVER ADVANCES.

                  (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and
during the term of this Agreement, Lender agrees to make advances ("Advances")
to Borrowers in an amount at any one time outstanding not to exceed an amount
equal to the lesser of (i) the Maximum Revolver Amount less the Letter of Credit
Usage, less the principal amount from time to time outstanding on the Term Loan,
or (ii) the Borrowing Base less the Letter of Credit Usage.

                  (b) Anything to the contrary in this Section 2.1
notwithstanding, Lender shall have the right to establish reserves in such
amounts, and with respect to such matters, as Lender in its Permitted Discretion
shall deem necessary or appropriate, against the Borrowing Base, including,
without limitation, reserves (i) with respect to (A) sums that Borrowers are
required to pay by any Section of this Agreement or any other Loan Document
(such as taxes, assessments, insurance premiums, or, in the case of leased
assets, rents or other amounts payable under such leases) and have failed to
pay, (B) amounts owing by Borrowers or their Significant Subsidiaries to any
Person to the extent secured by a Lien on, or trust over, any of the Collateral
(other than a Permitted Lien), which Lien or trust, in the Permitted Discretion
of Lender likely would have a priority superior to the Lender's Liens (such as
Liens or trusts in favor of landlords, warehousemen, carriers, mechanics,
materialmen, laborers, or suppliers, or Liens or trusts for ad valorem, excise,
sales, or other taxes where given priority under applicable law) in and to such
item of the Collateral, and (ii) after the occurrence and during the continuance
of an Event of Default, with respect to such other matters, as Lender in its
Permitted Discretion shall deem necessary or appropriate. The parties hereto
agree that a rent reserve equal to $120,000 shall be established from the
Closing Date through the Maturity Date.

                  (c) The Lender shall not make additional Advances hereunder to
the extent the outstanding principal amount of the Advances plus the then
outstanding principal amount of the Term Loan plus the Letter of Credit Usage
exceed the lowest of (i) the Maximum Revolver Amount, (ii) 2.00 times TTM
EBITDA, (iii) 50% of the Enterprise Valuation and (iv) Borrowers' Collections
with respect to Accounts arising from transactions located in the United States
for the immediately preceding 90 day period.

                  (d) Amounts borrowed pursuant to this Section 2.1 may be
repaid and, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, reborrowed at
any time during the term of this Agreement.

                                       2
<PAGE>

         2.2 TERM LOAN. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
on the Closing Date Lender agrees to make a term loan (the "Term Loan") to
Borrowers in an amount equal to the Term Loan Amount. The Term Loan shall be
repaid (i) in consecutive monthly installments commencing on January 1, 2005,
and continuing on the first day of each month thereafter up to and including
December 1, 2009, each in an amount equal to $200,000 and (ii) the unpaid
principal balance on the Maturity Date. The outstanding unpaid principal balance
and all accrued and unpaid interest under the Term Loan shall be due and payable
on the date of termination of this Agreement, whether by its terms, by
prepayment, or by acceleration. All amounts outstanding under the Term Loan
shall constitute Obligations. The outstanding amount from time to time of the
Term Loan shall be fully reserved against the Maximum Revolver Amount.

         2.3 BORROWING PROCEDURES AND SETTLEMENTS.

                  (a) PROCEDURE FOR BORROWING. Each Borrowing shall be made by
an irrevocable written request by an Authorized Person delivered to Lender. Such
notice must be received by Lender no later than 10:00 a.m. (California time) on
the Business Day that is the requested Funding Date specifying (i) the amount of
such Borrowing, and (ii) the requested Funding Date, which shall be a Business
Day. At Lender's election, in lieu of delivering the above-described written
request, any Authorized Person may give Lender telephonic notice of such request
by the required time. In such circumstances, Borrowers agree that any such
telephonic notice will be confirmed in writing within 24 hours of the giving of
such telephonic notice, but the failure to provide such written confirmation
shall not affect the validity of the request.

                  (b) MAKING OF ADVANCES. If Lender has received a timely
request for a Borrowing in accordance with the provisions hereof, and subject to
the satisfaction of the applicable terms and conditions set forth herein, Lender
shall make the proceeds of such Advance available to Borrowers on the applicable
Funding Date by transferring available funds equal to such proceeds to
Administrative Borrower's Designated Account.

         2.4 PAYMENTS.

                  (a) PAYMENTS BY BORROWERS. Except as otherwise expressly
provided herein, all payments by Borrowers shall be made to Lender's Account for
the account of Lender and shall be made in immediately available funds, no later
than 11:00 a.m. (California time) on the date specified herein. Any payment
received by Lender later than 11:00 a.m. (California time), shall be deemed to
have been received on the following Business Day and any applicable interest or
fee shall continue to accrue until such following Business Day.

                  (b) APPORTIONMENT AND APPLICATION.

                      (i) All payments shall be remitted to Lender and all such
payments and all proceeds of Collateral received by Lender, shall be applied as
follows:

                          (A) first, to pay any Lender Expenses then due to
Lender under the Loan Documents, until paid in full,

                                       3
<PAGE>

                          (B) second, to pay any fees or premiums then due to
Lender under the Loan Documents until paid in full,

                          (C) third, to pay interest due in respect of Advances
and the Term Loan until paid in full,

                          (D) fourth, to pay all principal amounts then due and
payable (other than as a result of an acceleration thereof) with respect to the
Term Loan until paid in full,

                          (E) fifth, so long as no Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing, and at Lender's election, to pay amounts then due and owing
by Administrative Borrower or its Subsidiaries in respect of Bank Products,
until paid in full,

                          (F) sixth, so long as no Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing, to pay the principal of all Advances until paid in full,

                          (G) seventh, if an Event of Default has occurred and
is continuing, ratably (i) to pay the principal of all Advances until paid in
full, (ii) to Lender, to be held by Lender as cash collateral in an amount up to
105% of the Letter of Credit Usage until paid in full, and (iii) to Lender, to
be held by Lender, for the benefit of the Bank Product Providers, as cash
collateral in an amount up to the amount of the Bank Product Reserve established
prior to the occurrence of, and not in contemplation of, the subject Event of
Default until Borrowers' and their Subsidiaries' obligations in respect of Bank
Products have been paid in full or the cash collateral amount has been
exhausted,

                          (H) eighth, if an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, to pay the outstanding principal balance of the Term Loan (in the
inverse order of the maturity of the installments due thereunder) until the Term
Loan is paid in full,

                          (I) ninth, if an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, to pay any other Obligations (including the provision of amounts to
Lender, to be held by Lender, for the benefit of the Bank Product Providers, as
cash collateral in an amount up to the amount determined by Lender in its
Permitted Discretion as the amount necessary to secure Borrowers' and their
Subsidiaries' obligations in respect of Bank Products), and,

                          (J) tenth, to Borrowers (to be wired to the Designated
Account) or such other Person entitled thereto under applicable law.

                      (ii) In each instance, so long as no Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, this Section 2.4(b) shall not apply to any payment
made by Borrowers to Lender and specified by Borrowers to be for the payment of
specific Obligations then due and payable (or prepayable) under any provision of
this Agreement.

                      (iii) For purposes of the foregoing, "paid in full" means
payment of all amounts owing under the Loan Documents according to the terms
thereof, including loan fees, service fees, professional fees, interest (and
specifically including interest accrued after the commencement of any Insolvency
Proceeding), default interest, interest on interest, and expense reimbursements,
whether or not any of the foregoing would be or is allowed or disallowed in
whole or in part in any Insolvency Proceeding.

                      (iv) In the event of a direct conflict between the
priority provisions of this Section 2.4 and other provisions contained in any
other Loan Document, it is the intention of the parties hereto that such
priority provisions in such documents shall be read together and construed, to
the fullest extent possible, to be in concert with each other. In the event of
any actual, irreconcilable conflict that cannot be resolved as aforesaid, the
terms and provisions of this Section 2.4 shall control and govern.

                  (c) PREPAYMENTS.

                      (i) Within ten (10) calendar days after delivery of
Parent's annual audited financial statements commencing with the period ending
December 31, 2005 and continuing for each period ending December 31 thereafter,
the Administrative Borrower shall make an annual prepayment of the outstanding
principal amount of the Term Loan in an aggregate amount equal to the lesser of
(i) $400,000 and (ii) 25% of the Excess Cash Flow for each preceding fiscal
year.

                      (ii) Immediately upon any sale or disposition by Parent or
any of its Significant Subsidiaries of property or assets other than (A) so long
as (1) no Default shall have occurred and be continuing, (2) there shall be no
Advances outstanding, and (3) the Domain Name Sales and the Infocrossing Stock
Sales, as the case may be, shall have occurred on or prior to January 1, 2006,
up to $3,000,000 of Net Cash Proceeds from the Domain Name Sales and up to
$2,000,000 of Net Cash Proceeds from the Infocrossing Stock Sale and (B) sales
or dispositions of Inventory in the ordinary course of business or sales of
Equipment or Software (as defined in the Code), the proceeds of which are used
to replace such Equipment or Software within 90 days after such sale,
Administrative Borrower shall prepay the outstanding principal amount of the
Term Loan in an amount equal to 100% of the Net Cash Proceeds received by such
Person in connection with such sales or dispositions to the extent that the
aggregate amount of Net Cash Proceeds received by such Person for all such sales
or dispositions exceeds $500,000 in any fiscal year. Nothing contained in this
subclause (i) shall permit Parent or any of its Significant Subsidiaries to sell
or otherwise dispose of any property or assets other than in accordance with
Section 6.4.

                      (iii) Immediately upon the receipt by Parent or any of its
Significant Subsidiaries of any Extraordinary Receipts in excess of $1,000,000
in the aggregate, Administrative Borrower shall prepay the outstanding principal
of the Term Loan in an amount equal to 100% of such Extraordinary Receipts, net
of any reasonable expenses incurred in collecting such Extraordinary Receipts;
provided, however, that the exceptions to the mandatory prepayments contained in
subclause (ii) above.

                      (iv) Immediately upon the occurrence of the outstanding
principal amount of the Advances plus the then outstanding principal amount of
the Term Loan plus the Letter of Credit Usage exceeding the lowest of (a) the
Maximum Revolver Amount, (b) 2.00 times TTM EBITDA, (c) 50% of the Enterprise
Valuation and (d) Borrowers' Collections with respect to Accounts arising from
transactions located in the United States for the immediately preceding 90 day
period, Administrative Borrower shall prepay the outstanding principal amount of
the Term Loan in an amount necessary to cause the outstanding principal amount
of the Advances plus the then outstanding principal amount of the Term Loan plus
the Letter of Credit Usage not to exceed the lowest of clauses (a) through (d)
above.

                                       5
<PAGE>

                      (v) The Borrowers may, at any time and from time to time,
on and after January 1, 2006, prepay an amount up to $3,000,000 in the aggregate
of the outstanding principal amount of the Term Loan, without premium or
penalty. The Administrative Borrower shall give the Lender notice of each
prepayment pursuant to this Section 2.4(c)(v) no later than 10:00 A.M. on the
Business Day before the date of such prepayment. Each such notice of prepayment
shall specify (A) the date such prepayment is to be made and (B) the amount of
the Term Loan to be prepaid. Amounts to be prepaid pursuant to this Section
2.4(c)(v) shall irrevocably be due and payable on the date specified in the
applicable notice of prepayment, together with interest thereon as provided in
Section 2.6.

                  (d) APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS. Each prepayment pursuant
to (c) above shall, be applied, first, to the outstanding principal amount of
the Term Loan until paid in full, and second, to the outstanding principal
amount of the Advances and to cash collateral in an amount equal to 105% of the
then extant Letter of Credit Usage. Except as expressly provided in the
immediately following sentence, all prepayments of the Term Loan shall be
applied against the remaining installments of principal of the Term Loan in the
inverse order of maturity. The Maximum Revolver Amount shall be permanently
reduced by the amount of such prepayment of the Term Loan pursuant to (c) (i),
(ii), (iii) and (iv) above. Prepayments of the Term Loan that are made by the
Borrower solely in connection with the events set forth in clause (iv) above,
shall be applied as follows: first, such prepayments in an aggregate amount less
than or equal to $400,000 in any fiscal year against the remaining installments
of principal of the Term Loan in the order of maturity and thereafter, any such
prepayments in an aggregate amount greater than $400,000 in any fiscal year
against the remaining installments of principal of the Term Loan in the inverse
order of maturity. By way of example, if the Borrower makes a one-time
prepayment of the Term Loan in an amount equal to $1,000,000 in order to cause
the outstanding principal amount of the Advances plus the then outstanding
principal amount of the Term Loan plus the Letter of Credit Usage not to exceed
the lowest of (i) the Maximum Revolver Amount, (ii) 2.00 times TTM EBITDA, (iii)
50% of the Enterprise Valuation and (iv) the Borrowers' Collections with respect
to Accounts arising from transactions located in the United States for the
immediately preceding 90 day period, then $400,000 of such $1,000,000 shall be
applied against the next two scheduled monthly principal payments, and the
remaining $600,000 of such $1,000,000 shall be applied to the last three
scheduled monthly principal payments due hereunder. The Applicable Prepayment
Premium (as defined in the Fee Letter) shall not be due in connection with any
mandatory prepayments required to be paid under Section 2.4(c).

         2.5 OVERADVANCES. If, at any time or for any reason, the outstanding
principal amount of the Advances plus the then outstanding principal amount of
the Term Loan plus the Letter of Credit Usage owed by Borrowers to Lender
hereunder is greater than any of the limitations set forth in Section 2.1 or
Section 2.12, as applicable (an "Overadvance"), Borrowers shall, within the
earlier of (i) three Business Days after notice from the Lender of such
Overadvance and (ii) one Business Day after the Borrower becomes aware of such
Overadvance, pay to Lender, in cash, the amount of such excess, which amount
shall be used by Lender to reduce the Obligations in accordance with the
priorities set forth in Section 2.4(b). In addition, Borrowers hereby promise to
pay the Obligations (including principal, interest, fees, costs, and expenses)
in Dollars in full as and when due and payable under the terms of this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents.

         2.6 INTEREST RATES AND LETTER OF CREDIT FEE: RATES, PAYMENTS, AND
CALCULATIONS.

                  (a) INTEREST RATES. Except as provided in clause (c) below,
all Obligations (except for undrawn Letters of Credit and except for Bank
Product Obligations) that have been charged to the Loan Account pursuant to the
terms hereof shall bear interest on the Daily Balance thereof as follows (i) if
the relevant Obligation is an Advance that is a LIBOR Rate Loan, at a per annum
rate equal to the LIBOR Rate plus the LIBOR Rate Margin, (ii) if the relevant
Obligation is the Term Loan, at a per annum rate equal to the Base Rate plus the
Base Rate Term Loan Margin, and (iii) otherwise, at a per annum rate equal to
the Base Rate plus the Base Rate Margin.

         The foregoing notwithstanding, at no time shall any portion of the
Obligations (other than Bank Product Obligations) bear interest on the Daily
Balance thereof at a per annum rate less than 4.50%. To the extent that interest
accrued hereunder at the rate set forth herein would be less than the foregoing
minimum daily rate, the interest rate chargeable hereunder for such day
automatically shall be deemed increased to the minimum rate.

                  (b) LETTER OF CREDIT FEE. Borrowers shall pay Lender a Letter
of Credit fee (in addition to the charges, commissions, fees, and costs set
forth in Section 2.12(d)) which shall accrue at a rate equal to 3.50% per annum
times the Daily Balance of the undrawn amount of all outstanding Letters of
Credit.

                  (c) DEFAULT RATE. Upon the occurrence and during the
continuation of an Event of Default (and at the election of Lender),

                      (i) all Obligations (except for undrawn Letters of Credit
and except for Bank Product Obligations) that have been charged to the Loan
Account pursuant to the terms hereof shall bear interest on the Daily Balance
thereof at a per annum rate equal to 2 percentage points above the per annum
rate otherwise applicable hereunder, and

                      (ii) the Letter of Credit fee provided for above shall be
increased to 2 percentage points above the per annum rate otherwise applicable
hereunder.

                  (d) PAYMENT. Except as provided to the contrary in Section
2.11 or Section 2.13(a), interest, Letter of Credit fees, and all other fees
payable hereunder shall be due and payable, in arrears, on the first day of each
month at any time that any Obligations are outstanding or at any time that
Lender has an obligation to extend credit hereunder. Borrowers hereby authorize
Lender, from time to time, without prior notice to Borrowers, to charge all
interest and fees (when due and payable), all Lender Expenses (as and when
incurred), all charges, commissions, fees, and costs provided for in Section
2.12(e) (as and when accrued or incurred), all fees and costs provided for in
Section 2.11 (as and when accrued or incurred), and all other payments as and
when due and payable under any Loan Document (including the amounts due and
payable with respect to the Term Loan and including any amounts due and payable
to the Bank Product Providers in respect of Bank Products up to the amount of
the Bank Product Reserve) to Borrowers' Loan Account, which amounts thereafter
shall constitute Advances hereunder and shall accrue interest at the rate then
applicable to Advances hereunder. Any interest not paid when due shall be
compounded by being charged to Borrowers' Loan Account and shall thereafter
constitute Advances hereunder and shall accrue interest at the rate then
applicable to Advances that are Base Rate Loans hereunder.

                                       7
<PAGE>

                  (e) COMPUTATION. All interest and fees chargeable under the
Loan Documents shall be computed on the basis of a 360 day year for the actual
number of days elapsed. In the event the Base Rate is changed from time to time
hereafter, the rates of interest hereunder based upon the Base Rate
automatically and immediately shall be increased or decreased by an amount equal
to such change in the Base Rate.

                  (f) INTENT TO LIMIT CHARGES TO MAXIMUM LAWFUL RATE. In no
event shall the interest rate or rates payable under this Agreement, plus any
other amounts paid in connection herewith, exceed the highest rate permissible
under any law that a court of competent jurisdiction shall, in a final
determination, deem applicable. Borrowers and Lender, in executing and
delivering this Agreement, intend legally to agree upon the rate or rates of
interest and manner of payment stated within it; provided, however, that,
anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, if said rate or rates
of interest or manner of payment exceeds the maximum allowable under applicable
law, then, ipso facto, as of the date of this Agreement, Borrowers are and shall
be liable only for the payment of such maximum as allowed by law, and payment
received from Borrowers in excess of such legal maximum, whenever received,
shall be applied to reduce the principal balance of the Obligations to the
extent of such excess.

         2.7 CASH MANAGEMENT.

                  (a) Borrowers shall and shall cause each of their Significant
Subsidiaries to (i) establish and maintain cash management services of a type
and on terms satisfactory to Lender at one or more of the banks set forth on
Schedule 2.7(a) (each a "Cash Management Bank"), and shall request in writing
and otherwise take such reasonable steps to ensure that all of their and their
Significant Subsidiaries' Account Debtors forward payment of the amounts owed by
them directly to such Cash Management Bank for deposit into a cash management
account (each a "Cash Management Account") and (ii) deposit or cause to be
deposited promptly, and in any event no later than the first Business Day after
the date of receipt thereof, all of their Collections (including those sent
directly by their Account Debtors to Borrowers or their Significant
Subsidiaries) into such Cash Management Account.

                  (b) Each Cash Management Bank shall establish and maintain
Cash Management Agreements with Lender and Borrowers, in form and substance
acceptable to Lender. Each such Cash Management Agreement shall provide, among
other things, that (i) the Cash Management Bank will comply with any
instructions originated by Lender directing the disposition of the funds in such
Cash Management Account without further consent by Borrowers or their
Significant Subsidiaries, as applicable, (ii) the Cash Management Bank has no
rights of setoff or recoupment or any other claim against the applicable Cash
Management Account other than for payment of its service fees and other charges
directly related to the administration of such Cash Management Account and for
returned checks or other items of payment, and (iii) so long as (A) a Default
shall have occurred and be continuing or (B) outstanding Advances are greater
than $1,000,000 (any such event referred to in clauses (A) and (B) is
hereinafter called a "Cash Management Event"), then one Business Day after the
Lender has notified the Borrower, each Cash Management Bank will forward, by
daily sweep, all amounts in the applicable Cash Management Account to the
Lender's Account, and in all other cases such funds shall be swept on a regular
basis from the applicable Cash Management Account to a Deposit Account pursuant
to which the Lender has a Control Agreement as required by Section 6.12 hereof.
The right of the Lender under this Section 2.7(b) to instruct each Cash
Management Bank to sweep to the Lender's Account shall remain effective at all
times during the occurrence and continuance of a Cash Management Event and
thereafter for a period of 30 days following the date on which the Cash
Management Event has been cured by the Borrower (the period from commencement of
the Cash Management Event to the end of such 30 day period in which the Cash
Management Event has been cured is hereinafter called a "Cash Management
Period"). On or before the Business Day after the last day of a Cash Management
Period, the Lender shall (i) by written notice to such Cash Management Bank
effective as of such Business Day, withdraw the instruction to such Cash
Management Bank and instruct such Cash Management Bank to resume sweeping
amounts from the applicable Cash Management Account to such Deposit Account
pursuant to which the Lender has a Control Agreement as required by Section 6.12
hereof. The Administrative Borrower may make one request of the Lender in a
consecutive 12-month period to deactivate the Cash Management Period.

                                       8
<PAGE>

                  (c) So long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and
is continuing, Administrative Borrower may amend Schedule 2.7(a) to add or
replace a Cash Management Bank or Cash Management Account; provided, however,
that (i) such prospective Cash Management Bank shall be reasonably satisfactory
to Lender, and (ii) prior to the time of the opening of such Cash Management
Account, a Borrower or its Significant Subsidiary, as applicable, and such
prospective Cash Management Bank shall have executed and delivered to Lender a
Cash Management Agreement. Borrowers (or their Significant Subsidiaries, as
applicable), shall close any of their Cash Management Accounts (and establish
replacement cash management accounts in accordance with the foregoing sentence)
promptly and in any event within 30 days of notice from Lender that the
creditworthiness of any Cash Management Bank is no longer acceptable in Lender's
reasonable judgment, or as promptly as practicable and in any event within 60
days of notice from Lender that the operating performance, funds transfer, or
availability procedures or performance of the Cash Management Bank with respect
to Cash Management Accounts or Lender's liability under any Cash Management
Agreement with such Cash Management Bank is no longer acceptable in Lender's
reasonable judgment.

                  (d) The Cash Management Accounts shall be cash collateral
accounts subject to Control Agreements.

         2.8 CREDITING PAYMENTS; CLEARANCE CHARGE. The receipt of any payment
item by Lender (whether from transfers to Lender by the Cash Management Banks
pursuant to the Cash Management Agreements or otherwise) shall not be considered
a payment on account unless such payment item is a wire transfer of immediately
available federal funds made to the Lender's Account or unless and until such
payment item is honored when presented for payment. Should any payment item not
be honored when presented for payment, then Borrowers shall be deemed not to
have made such payment and interest shall be calculated accordingly. Anything to
the contrary contained herein notwithstanding, any payment item shall be deemed
received by Lender only if it is received into the Lender's Account on a
Business Day on or before 11:00 a.m. (California time). If any payment item is
received into the Lender's Account on a non-Business Day or after 11:00 a.m.
(California time) on a Business Day, it shall be deemed to have been received by
Lender as of the opening of business on the immediately following Business Day.
From and after the Closing Date, Lender shall be entitled to charge Borrowers
for one Business Day of "clearance" at the rate then applicable under Section
2.6 to Advances that are Base Rate Loans on all Collections that are received by
Borrowers and their Significant Subsidiaries (regardless of whether forwarded by
the Cash Management Banks to Lender). This across-the-board one Business Day
clearance charge on all Collections of Borrowers and their Significant
Subsidiaries is acknowledged by the parties to constitute an integral aspect of
the pricing of the financing of Borrowers and shall apply irrespective of
whether or not there are any outstanding monetary Obligations; the effect of
such clearance charge being the equivalent of charging interest on such
Collections through the completion of a period ending one Business Days after
the receipt thereof.

                                       9
<PAGE>

         2.9 DESIGNATED ACCOUNT. Lender is authorized to make the Advances and
the Term Loan, and Lender is authorized to issue the Letters of Credit, under
this Agreement based upon telephonic or other instructions received from anyone
purporting to be an Authorized Person or, without instructions, if pursuant to
Section 2.6(d). Administrative Borrower agrees to establish and maintain the
Designated Account with the Designated Account Bank for the purpose of receiving
the proceeds of the Advances requested by Borrowers and made by Lender
hereunder. Unless otherwise agreed by Lender and Administrative Borrower, any
Advance requested by Borrowers and made by Lender hereunder shall be made to the
Designated Account.

         2.10 MAINTENANCE OF LOAN ACCOUNT; STATEMENTS OF OBLIGATIONS. Lender
shall maintain an account on its books in the name of Borrowers (the "Loan
Account") on which Borrowers will be charged with the Term Loan, all Advances
made by Lender to Borrowers or for Borrowers' account, the Letters of Credit
issued by Lender for Borrowers' account, and with all other payment Obligations
hereunder or under the other Loan Documents (except for Bank Product
Obligations), including, accrued interest, fees and expenses, and Lender
Expenses. In accordance with Section 2.8, the Loan Account will be credited with
all payments received by Lender from Borrowers or for Borrowers' account,
including all amounts received in the Lender's Account from any Cash Management
Bank. Lender shall render statements regarding the Loan Account to
Administrative Borrower, including principal, interest, fees, and including an
itemization of all charges and expenses constituting Lender Expenses owing, and
such statements, absent manifest error, shall be conclusively presumed to be
correct and accurate and constitute an account stated between Borrowers and
Lender unless, within 30 days after receipt thereof by Administrative Borrower,
Administrative Borrower shall deliver to Lender written objection thereto
describing the error or errors contained in any such statements.

         2.11 FEES. Borrowers shall pay to Lender, as and when due and payable
under the terms of the Fee Letter, the fees set forth in the Fee Letter.

                                       10

         2.12 LETTERS OF CREDIT.

                  (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
Lender agrees to issue letters of credit for the account of Borrowers (each, an
"L/C") or to purchase participations or execute indemnities or reimbursement
obligations (each such undertaking, an "L/C Undertaking") with respect to
letters of credit issued by an Underlying Issuer (as of the Closing Date, the
prospective Underlying Issuer is to be Wells Fargo) for the account of
Borrowers. Each request for the issuance of a Letter of Credit or the amendment,
renewal, or extension of any outstanding Letter of Credit shall be made in
writing by an Authorized Person and delivered to Lender via hand delivery,
facsimile, or other electronic method of transmission reasonably in advance of
the requested date of issuance, amendment, renewal, or extension. Each such
request shall be in form and substance satisfactory to Lender in its Permitted
Discretion and shall specify (i) the amount of such Letter of Credit, (ii) the
date of issuance, amendment, renewal, or extension of such Letter of Credit,
(iii) the expiration date of such Letter of Credit, (iv) the name and address of
the beneficiary thereof (or the beneficiary of the Underlying Letter of Credit,
as applicable), and (v) such other information (including, in the case of an
amendment, renewal, or extension, identification of the outstanding Letter of
Credit to be so amended, renewed, or extended) as shall be necessary to prepare,
amend, renew, or extend such Letter of Credit. If requested by Lender, Borrowers
also shall be an applicant under the application with respect to any Underlying
Letter of Credit that is to be the subject of an L/C Undertaking. Lender shall
have no obligation to issue a Letter of Credit if any of the following would
result after giving effect to the issuance of such requested Letter of Credit:

                      (i) the Letter of Credit Usage would exceed the Borrowing
Base less the outstanding amount of Advances, or

                      (ii) the Letter of Credit Usage would exceed $1,500,000 or

                      (iii) the Letter of Credit Usage would exceed the Maximum
Revolver Amount less the outstanding amount of Advances.

                  Borrowers and Lender acknowledge and agree that certain
Underlying Letters of Credit may be issued to support letters of credit that
already are outstanding as of the Closing Date. Each Letter of Credit (and
corresponding Underlying Letter of Credit) shall be in form and substance
acceptable to Lender (in the exercise of its Permitted Discretion), including
the requirement that the amounts payable thereunder must be payable in Dollars.
If Lender is obligated to advance funds under a Letter of Credit, Borrowers
immediately shall reimburse such L/C Disbursement to Lender by paying to Lender
an amount equal to such L/C Disbursement not later than 11:00 a.m., California
time, on the date that such L/C Disbursement is made, if Administrative Borrower
shall have received written or telephonic notice of such L/C Disbursement prior
to 10:00 a.m., California time, on such date, or, if such notice has not been
received by Administrative Borrower prior to such time on such date, then not
later than 11:00 a.m., California time, on the Business Day that Administrative
Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is received prior to 10:00 a.m.,
California time, on the date of receipt, and, in the absence of such
reimbursement, the L/C Disbursement immediately and automatically shall be
deemed to be an Advance hereunder and, thereafter, shall bear interest at the
rate then applicable to Advances that are Base Rate Loans under Section 2.6. To
the extent an L/C Disbursement is deemed to be an Advance hereunder, Borrowers'
obligation to reimburse such L/C Disbursement shall be discharged and replaced
by the resulting Advance.

                  (b) Each Borrower hereby agrees to indemnify, save, defend,
and hold Lender harmless from any loss, cost, expense, or liability, and
reasonable attorneys fees incurred by Lender arising out of or in connection
with any Letter of Credit; provided, however, that no Borrower shall be
obligated hereunder to indemnify for any loss, cost, expense, or liability to
the extent that it is caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of
Lender. Each Borrower agrees to be bound by the Underlying Issuer's regulations
and interpretations of any Underlying Letter of Credit or by Lender's
interpretations of any L/C issued by Lender to or for such Borrower's account,
even though this interpretation may be different from such Borrower's own, and
each Borrower understands and agrees that Lender shall not be liable for any
error, negligence, or mistake, whether of omission or commission, in following
Borrowers' instructions or those contained in the Letter of Credit or any
modifications, amendments, or supplements thereto. Each Borrower understands
that the L/C Undertakings may require Lender to indemnify the Underlying Issuer
for certain costs or liabilities arising out of claims by Borrowers against such
Underlying Issuer. Each Borrower hereby agrees to indemnify, save, defend, and
hold Lender harmless with respect to any loss, cost, expense (including
reasonable attorneys fees), or liability incurred by Lender under any L/C
Undertaking as a result of Lender's indemnification of any Underlying Issuer;
provided, however, that no Borrower shall be obligated hereunder to indemnify
for any loss, cost, expense, or liability to the extent that it is caused by the
gross negligence or willful misconduct of Lender. Each Borrower hereby
acknowledges and agrees that Lender shall not be responsible for delays, errors,
or omissions resulting from the malfunction of equipment in connection with any
Letter of Credit.

                  (c) Each Borrower hereby authorizes and directs any Underlying
Issuer to deliver to Lender all instruments, documents, and other writings and
property received by such Underlying Issuer pursuant to such Underlying Letter
of Credit and to accept and rely upon Lender's instructions with respect to all
matters arising in connection with such Underlying Letter of Credit and the
related application.

                  (d) Any and all issuance charges, commissions, fees, and costs
incurred by Lender relating to Underlying Letters of Credit shall be Lender
Expenses for purposes of this Agreement and immediately shall be reimbursable by
Borrowers to Lender for the account of Lender; it being acknowledged and agreed
by each Borrower that, as of the Closing Date, the issuance charge imposed by
the prospective Underlying Issuer is 0.825% per annum times the face amount of
each Underlying Letter of Credit, that such issuance charge may be changed from
time to time, and that the Underlying Issuer also imposes a schedule of charges
for amendments, extensions, drawings, and renewals.

                  (e) If by reason of (i) any change after the Closing Date in
any applicable law, treaty, rule, or regulation or any change in the
interpretation or application thereof by any Governmental Authority, or (ii)
compliance by the Underlying Issuer or Lender with any direction, request, or
requirement (irrespective of whether having the force of law) of any
Governmental Authority or monetary authority including, Regulation D of the
Federal Reserve Board as from time to time in effect (and any successor
thereto):

                                       12
<PAGE>

                      (i) any reserve, deposit, or similar requirement is or
shall be imposed or modified in respect of any Letter of Credit issued
hereunder, or

                      (ii) there shall be imposed on the Underlying Issuer or
Lender any other condition regarding any Underlying Letter of Credit or any
Letter of Credit issued pursuant hereto;

and the result of the foregoing is to increase, directly or indirectly, the cost
to Lender of issuing, making, guaranteeing, or maintaining any Letter of Credit
or to reduce the amount receivable in respect thereof by Lender, then, and in
any such case, Lender may, at any time within a reasonable period after the
additional cost is incurred or the amount received is reduced, notify
Administrative Borrower, and Borrowers shall pay on demand such amounts as
Lender may specify to be necessary to compensate Lender for such additional cost
or reduced receipt, together with interest on such amount from the date of such
demand until payment in full thereof at the rate then applicable to Base Rate
Loans hereunder. The determination by Lender of any amount due pursuant to this
Section, as set forth in a certificate setting forth the calculation thereof in
reasonable detail, shall, in the absence of manifest or demonstrable error, be
final and conclusive and binding on all of the parties hereto.

         2.13 LIBOR OPTION.

                  (a) INTEREST AND INTEREST PAYMENT DATES. In lieu of having
interest charged at the rate based upon the Base Rate, Borrowers shall have the
option (the "LIBOR Option") to have interest on all or a portion of the Advances
or the Term Loan be charged at a rate of interest based upon the LIBOR Rate.
Interest on LIBOR Rate Loans shall be payable on the earliest of (i) the last
day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, provided, however, that, subject
to the following clauses (ii) and (iii), in the case of any Interest Period
greater than 3 months in duration, interest shall be payable at 3 month
intervals after the commencement of the applicable Interest Period and on the
last day of such Interest Period), (ii) the occurrence of an Event of Default in
consequence of which Lender has elected to accelerate the maturity of all or any
portion of the Obligations, or (iii) termination of this Agreement pursuant to
the terms hereof. On the last day of each applicable Interest Period, unless
Administrative Borrower properly has exercised the LIBOR Option with respect
thereto, the interest rate applicable to such LIBOR Rate Loan automatically
shall convert to the rate of interest then applicable to Base Rate Loans of the
same type hereunder. At any time that an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, Borrowers no longer shall have the option to request that Advances
or the Term Loan bear interest at a rate based upon the LIBOR Rate and Lender
shall have the right to convert the interest rate on all outstanding LIBOR Rate
Loans to the rate then applicable to Base Rate Loans hereunder.

                  (b) LIBOR ELECTION.

                      (i) Administrative Borrower may, at any time and from time
to time, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, elect to
exercise the LIBOR Option by notifying Lender prior to 11:00 a.m. (California
time) at least 2 Business Days prior to the commencement of the proposed
Interest Period (the "LIBOR Deadline"). Notice of Administrative Borrower's
election of the LIBOR Option for a permitted portion of the Advances or the Term
Loan and an Interest Period pursuant to this Section shall be made by delivery
to Lender of a LIBOR Notice received by Lender before the LIBOR Deadline, or by
telephonic notice received by Lender before the LIBOR Deadline (to be confirmed
by delivery to Lender of a LIBOR Notice received by Lender prior to 5:00 p.m.
(California time) on the same day).

                                       13
<PAGE>

                      (ii) Each LIBOR Notice shall be irrevocable and binding on
Borrowers. In connection with each LIBOR Rate Loan, each Borrower shall
indemnify, defend, and hold Lender harmless against any loss, cost, or expense
incurred by Lender as a result of (a) the payment of any principal of any LIBOR
Rate Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto
(including as a result of an Event of Default), (b) the conversion of any LIBOR
Rate Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto,
or (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any LIBOR Rate Loan on
the date specified in any LIBOR Notice delivered pursuant hereto (such losses,
costs, and expenses, collectively, "Funding Losses"). Funding Losses shall be
deemed to equal the amount determined by Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i)
the amount of interest that would have accrued on the principal amount of such
LIBOR Rate Loan had such event not occurred, at the LIBOR Rate that would have
been applicable thereto, for the period from the date of such event to the last
day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure
to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have been the Interest
Period therefor), minus (ii) the amount of interest that would accrue on such
principal amount for such period at the interest rate which Lender would be
offered were it to be offered, at the commencement of such period, Dollar
deposits of a comparable amount and period in the London interbank market. A
certificate of Lender delivered to Administrative Borrower setting forth any
amount or amounts that Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section
2.13 shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

                      (iii) Borrowers shall have not more than 5 LIBOR Rate
Loans in effect at any given time. Borrowers only may exercise the LIBOR Option
for LIBOR Rate Loans of at least $1,000,000 and integral multiples of $500,000
in excess thereof.

                  (c) PREPAYMENTS. Borrowers may prepay LIBOR Rate Loans at any
time; provided, however, that in the event that LIBOR Rate Loans are prepaid on
any date that is not the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto,
including as a result of any automatic prepayment through the required
application by Lender of proceeds of Borrowers' and their Subsidiaries'
Collections in accordance with Section 2.4(b) or for any other reason, including
early termination of the term of this Agreement or acceleration of all or any
portion of the Obligations pursuant to the terms hereof, each Borrower shall
indemnify, defend, and hold Lender and its Participants harmless against any and
all Funding Losses in accordance with clause (b)(ii) above.

                  (d) SPECIAL PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO LIBOR RATE.

                      (i) The LIBOR Rate may be adjusted by Lender on a
prospective basis to take into account any additional or increased costs to
Lender of maintaining or obtaining any Eurodollar deposits or increased costs,
in each case, due to changes in applicable law occurring subsequent to the
commencement of the then applicable Interest Period, including changes in tax
laws (except changes of general applicability in corporate income tax laws) and
changes in the reserve requirements imposed by the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System (or any successor), excluding the Reserve Percentage,
which additional or increased costs would increase the cost of funding loans
bearing interest at the LIBOR Rate. In any such event, Lender shall give
Administrative Borrower notice of such a determination and adjustment and, upon
its receipt of the notice from Lender, Administrative Borrower may, by notice to
Lender (y) require Lender to furnish to Administrative Borrower a statement
setting forth the basis for adjusting such LIBOR Rate and the method for
determining the amount of such adjustment, or (z) repay the LIBOR Rate Loans
with respect to which such adjustment is made (together with any amounts due
under clause (b)(ii) above).

                                       14
<PAGE>

                      (ii) In the event that any change in market conditions or
any law, regulation, treaty, or directive, or any change therein or in the
interpretation of application thereof, shall at any time after the date hereof,
in the reasonable opinion of Lender, make it unlawful or impractical for Lender
to fund or maintain LIBOR Advances or to continue such funding or maintaining,
or to determine or charge interest rates at the LIBOR Rate, Lender shall give
notice of such changed circumstances to Administrative Borrower and (y) in the
case of any LIBOR Rate Loans that are outstanding, the date specified in
Lender's notice shall be deemed to be the last day of the Interest Period of
such LIBOR Rate Loans, and interest upon the LIBOR Rate Loans of Lender
thereafter shall accrue interest at the rate then applicable to Base Rate Loans,
and (z) Borrowers shall not be entitled to elect the LIBOR Option until Lender
determines that it would no longer be unlawful or impractical to do so.

                  (e) NO REQUIREMENT OF MATCHED FUNDING. Anything to the
contrary contained herein notwithstanding, neither Lender, nor any of its
Participants, is required actually to acquire Eurodollar deposits to fund or
otherwise match fund any Obligation as to which interest accrues at the LIBOR
Rate. The provisions of this Section shall apply as if Lender or its
Participants had match funded any Obligation as to which interest is accruing at
the LIBOR Rate by acquiring Eurodollar deposits for each Interest Period in the
amount of the LIBOR Rate Loans.

         2.14 CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. If, after the date hereof, Lender determines
that (i) the adoption of or change in any law, rule, regulation or guideline
regarding capital requirements for banks or bank holding companies, or any
change in the interpretation or application thereof by any Governmental
Authority charged with the administration thereof, or (ii) compliance by Lender
or its parent bank holding company with any guideline, request or directive of
any such entity regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of
law), has the effect of reducing the return on Lender's or such holding
company's capital as a consequence of Lender's obligations hereunder to a level
below that which Lender or such holding company could have achieved but for such
adoption, change, or compliance (taking into consideration Lender's or such
holding company's then existing policies with respect to capital adequacy and
assuming the full utilization of such entity's capital) by any amount deemed by
Lender to be material, then Lender may notify Administrative Borrower thereof.
Following receipt of such notice, Borrowers agree to pay Lender on demand the
amount of such reduction of return of capital as and when such reduction is
determined, payable within 90 days after presentation by Lender of a statement
in the amount and setting forth in reasonable detail Lender's calculation
thereof and the assumptions upon which such calculation was based (which
statement shall be deemed true and correct absent manifest error). In
determining such amount, Lender may use any reasonable averaging and attribution
methods.

         2.15 JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY OF BORROWERS.

                  (a) Each Borrower is accepting joint and several liability
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents in consideration of the financial
accommodations to be provided by Lender under this Agreement, for the mutual
benefit, directly and indirectly, of each Borrower and in consideration of the
undertakings of the other Borrowers to accept joint and several liability for
the Obligations.

                  (b) Each Borrower, jointly and severally, hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally accepts, not merely as a surety but also as a co-debtor,
joint and several liability with the other Borrowers, with respect to the
payment and performance of all of the Obligations (including, without
limitation, any Obligations arising under this Section 2.15), it being the
intention of the parties hereto that all the Obligations shall be the joint and
several obligations of each Borrower without preferences or distinction among
them.

                  (c) If and to the extent that any Borrower shall fail to make
any payment with respect to any of the Obligations as and when due or to perform
any of the Obligations in accordance with the terms thereof, then in each such
event the other Borrowers will make such payment with respect to, or perform,
such Obligation.

                  (d) The Obligations of each Borrower under the provisions of
this Section 2.15 constitute the absolute and unconditional, full recourse
Obligations of each Borrower enforceable against each such Borrower to the full
extent of its properties and assets, irrespective of the validity, regularity or
enforceability of this Agreement or any other circumstances whatsoever.

                  (e) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement,
each Borrower hereby waives notice of acceptance of its joint and several
liability, notice of any Advances or Letters of Credit issued under or pursuant
to this Agreement, notice of the occurrence of any Default, Event of Default, or
of any demand for any payment under this Agreement, notice of any action at any
time taken or omitted by Lender under or in respect of any of the Obligations,
any requirement of diligence or to mitigate damages and, generally, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, all demands, notices and other formalities
of every kind in connection with this Agreement (except as otherwise provided in
this Agreement). Each Borrower hereby assents to, and waives notice of, any
extension or postponement of the time for the payment of any of the Obligations,
the acceptance of any payment of any of the Obligations, the acceptance of any
partial payment thereon, any waiver, consent or other action or acquiescence by
Lender at any time or times in respect of any default by any Borrower in the
performance or satisfaction of any term, covenant, condition or provision of
this Agreement, any and all other indulgences whatsoever by Lender in respect of
any of the Obligations, and the taking, addition, substitution or release, in
whole or in part, at any time or times, of any security for any of the
Obligations or the addition, substitution or release, in whole or in part, of
any Borrower. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Borrower
assents to any other action or delay in acting or failure to act on the part of
Lender with respect to the failure by any Borrower to comply with any of its
respective Obligations, including, without limitation, any failure strictly or
diligently to assert any right or to pursue any remedy or to comply fully with
applicable laws or regulations thereunder, which might, but for the provisions
of this Section 2.15 afford grounds for terminating, discharging or relieving
any Borrower, in whole or in part, from any of its Obligations under this
Section 2.15, it being the intention of each Borrower that, so long as any of
the Obligations hereunder remain unsatisfied, the Obligations of each Borrower
under this Section 2.15 shall not be discharged except by performance and then
only to the extent of such performance. The Obligations of each Borrower under
this Section 2.15 shall not be diminished or rendered unenforceable by any
winding up, reorganization, arrangement, liquidation, reconstruction or similar
proceeding with respect to any Borrower or Lender.

                                       16
<PAGE>

                  (f) Each Borrower represents and warrants to Lender that such
Borrower is currently informed of the financial condition of Borrowers and of
all other circumstances which a diligent inquiry would reveal and which bear
upon the risk of nonpayment of the Obligations. Each Borrower further represents
and warrants to Lender that such Borrower has read and understands the terms and
conditions of the Loan Documents. Each Borrower hereby covenants that such
Borrower will continue to keep informed of Borrowers' financial condition, the
financial condition of other guarantors, if any, and of all other circumstances
which bear upon the risk of nonpayment or nonperformance of the Obligations.

                  (g) Intentionally Omitted.

                  (h) Each Borrower waives all rights and defenses that such
Borrower may have because the Obligations are secured by Real Property. This
means, among other things:

                      (i) Lender may collect from such Borrower without first
foreclosing on any Real or Personal Property Collateral pledged by Borrowers.

                      (ii) If Lender forecloses on any Real Property Collateral
pledged by Borrowers:

                           (A) The amount of the Obligations may be reduced only
by the price for which that collateral is sold at the foreclosure sale, even if
the collateral is worth more than the sale price.

                           (B) Lender may collect from such Borrower even if
Lender, by foreclosing on the Real Property Collateral, has destroyed any right
such Borrower may have to collect from the other Borrowers.

This is an unconditional and irrevocable waiver of any rights and defenses such
Borrower may have because the Obligations are secured by Real Property.

                  (i) The provisions of this Section 2.15 are made for the
benefit of Lender and its successors and assigns, and may be enforced by it or
them from time to time against any or all Borrowers as often as occasion
therefor may arise and without requirement on the part of Lender, successor, or
assign first to marshal any of its or their claims or to exercise any of its or
their rights against any Borrower or to exhaust any remedies available to it or
them against any Borrower or to resort to any other source or means of obtaining
payment of any of the Obligations hereunder or to elect any other remedy. The
provisions of this Section 2.15 shall remain in effect until all of the
Obligations shall have been paid in full or otherwise fully satisfied. If at any
time, any payment, or any part thereof, made in respect of any of the
Obligations, is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned by Lender
upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of any Borrower, or otherwise,
the provisions of this Section 2.15 will forthwith be reinstated in effect, as
though such payment had not been made.

                                       17
<PAGE>

                  (j) Each Borrower hereby agrees that it will not enforce any
of its rights of contribution or subrogation against any other Borrower with
respect to any liability incurred by it hereunder or under any of the other Loan
Documents, any payments made by it to Lender with respect to any of the
Obligations or any collateral security therefor until such time as all of the
Obligations have been paid in full in cash. Any claim which any Borrower may
have against any other Borrower with respect to any payments to Lender hereunder
or under any other Loan Documents are hereby expressly made subordinate and
junior in right of payment, without limitation as to any increases in the
Obligations arising hereunder or thereunder, to the prior payment in full in
cash of the Obligations and, in the event of any insolvency, bankruptcy,
receivership, liquidation, reorganization or other similar proceeding under the
laws of any jurisdiction relating to any Borrower, its debts or its assets,
whether voluntary or involuntary, all such Obligations shall be paid in full in
cash before any payment or distribution of any character, whether in cash,
securities or other property, shall be made to any other Borrower therefor.

                  (k) Each Borrower hereby agrees that, after the occurrence and
during the continuance of any Default or Event of Default, the payment of any
amounts due with respect to the indebtedness owing by any Borrower to any other
Borrower is hereby subordinated to the prior payment in full in cash of the
Obligations. Each Borrower hereby agrees that after the occurrence and during
the continuance of any Default or Event of Default, such Borrower will not
demand, sue for or otherwise attempt to collect any indebtedness of any other
Borrower owing to such Borrower until the Obligations shall have been paid in
full in cash. If, notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, such Borrower shall
collect, enforce or receive any amounts in respect of such indebtedness, such
amounts shall be collected, enforced and received by such Borrower as trustee
for the Lender, and such Borrower shall deliver any such amounts to Lender for
application to the Obligations in accordance with Section 2.4(b).

3. CONDITIONS; TERM OF AGREEMENT.

         3.1 CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO THE INITIAL EXTENSION OF CREDIT. The
obligation of Lender to make the initial extension of credit provided for
hereunder is subject to the fulfillment, to the satisfaction of Lender of each
of the conditions precedent set forth on Schedule 3.1 (the making of such
initial extension of credit by Lender being conclusively deemed to be its
satisfaction or waiver of such conditions precedent).

         3.2 CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO ALL EXTENSIONS OF CREDIT. The obligation of
Lender to make any Advances hereunder at any time (or to extend any other credit
hereunder) shall be subject to the following conditions precedent:

                  (a) the representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement or in the other Loan Documents shall be true and correct in all
material respects on and as of the date of such extension of credit, as though
made on and as of such date (except to the extent that such representations and
warranties relate solely to an earlier date);

                                       18
<PAGE>

                  (b) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing on the date of such extension of credit, nor shall either result from
the making thereof;

                  (c) no injunction, writ, restraining order, or other order of
any nature restricting or prohibiting, directly or indirectly, the extending of
such credit shall have been issued and remain in force by any Governmental
Authority against any Borrower, Lender, or any of their Affiliates; and

                  (d) no Material Adverse Change shall have occurred.

         3.3 TERM. The Agreement shall continue in full force and effect for a
term ending on December 31, 2009 (the "Maturity Date"). The foregoing
notwithstanding, Lender shall have the right to terminate its obligations under
this Agreement immediately and without notice upon the occurrence and during the
continuation of an Event of Default.

         3.4 EFFECT OF TERMINATION. On the date of termination of this
Agreement, all Obligations (including contingent reimbursement obligations of
Borrowers with respect to outstanding Letters of Credit and including all Bank
Product Obligations) immediately shall become due and payable without notice or
demand (including (a) either (i) providing cash collateral to be held by Lender
in an amount equal to 105% of the Letter of Credit Usage, or (ii) causing the
original Letters of Credit to be returned to Lender, and (b) providing cash
collateral (in an amount determined by Lender as sufficient to satisfy the
reasonably estimated credit exposure) to be held by Lender for the benefit of
the Bank Product Providers with respect to the Bank Product Obligations). No
termination of this Agreement, however, shall relieve or discharge Borrowers or
their Subsidiaries of their duties, Obligations, or covenants hereunder or under
any other Loan Document and the Lender's Liens in the Collateral shall remain in
effect until all Obligations have been paid in full and Lender's obligations to
provide additional credit hereunder have been terminated. When this Agreement
has been terminated and all of the Obligations have been paid in full and
Lender's obligations to provide additional credit under the Loan Documents have
been terminated irrevocably, Lender will, at Borrowers' sole expense, execute
and deliver any termination statements, lien releases, mortgage releases,
re-assignments of trademarks, discharges of security interests, and other
similar discharge or release documents (and, if applicable, in recordable form)
as are reasonably necessary to release, as of record, the Lender's Liens and all
notices of security interests and liens previously filed by Lender with respect
to the Obligations.

         3.5 EARLY TERMINATION BY BORROWERS. Borrowers have the option, at any
time upon 30 days prior written notice by Administrative Borrower to Lender, to
terminate this Agreement by paying to Lender, in cash, the Obligations
(including (a) either (i) providing cash collateral to be held by Lender in an
amount equal to 105% of the Letter of Credit Usage, or (ii) causing the original
Letters of Credit to be returned to Lender, and (b) providing cash collateral
(in an amount determined by Lender as sufficient to satisfy the reasonably
estimated credit exposure) to be held by Lender for the benefit of the Bank
Product Providers with respect to the Bank Product Obligations), in full. If
Administrative Borrower has sent a notice of termination pursuant to the
provisions of this Section, then Lender's obligations to extend credit hereunder
shall terminate and Borrowers shall be obligated to repay the Obligations
(including (a) either (i) providing cash collateral to be held by Lender in an
amount equal to 105% of the Letter of Credit Usage, or (ii) causing the original
Letters of Credit to be returned to Lender, and (b) providing cash collateral
(in an amount determined by Lender as sufficient to satisfy the reasonably
estimated credit exposure) to be held by Lender for the benefit of the Bank
Product Providers with respect to the Bank Product Obligations), in full, on the
date set forth as the date of termination of this Agreement in such notice.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Administrative Borrower has sent such prior
written notice to Lender to terminate in accordance with this Section 3.5 and
(A) the Administrative Borrower subsequently elects to withdraw such request to
terminate within 15 days after sending such prior written notice to Lender
because of events outside the reasonable control of the Administrative Borrower,
then such initial notice to terminate shall be revoked and be of no force and
effect or (B) the Administrative Borrower requests that the Lender extend the
effective termination date set forth in such notice for a period not to exceed
30 days after the initial requested termination date because of events outside
the reasonable control of the Administrative Borrower, then such initial
requested termination date shall be extended for a period not to exceed 30 days
following the initial requested termination date. The Administrative Borrower
shall be entitled to make such request to revoke a termination or request to
extend a termination not more than one time during the term of this Agreement.

other extension of credit) made thereafter, as though made on and as of the date

representations and warranties relate solely to an earlier date) and such
representations and warranties shall survive the execution and delivery of this
Agreement:

have good and indefeasible title to, or a valid leasehold interest in, their
personal property assets and good and marketable title to, or a valid leasehold

services to such Account Debtor in the ordinary course of Borrowers' business,

5. AFFIRMATIVE COVENANTS.

                  Each Borrower covenants and agrees that, so long as any credit

Borrowers shall and shall cause each of their respective Significant
Subsidiaries to do all of the following:

         5.1 ACCOUNTING SYSTEM. Maintain a system of accounting that enables
Borrowers to produce financial statements in accordance with GAAP and maintain
records pertaining to the Collateral that contain information as from time to

allowances with respect to their and their Subsidiaries' sales.

         5.2 COLLATERAL REPORTING. Provide Lender with each of the reports set
forth on Schedule 5.2 at the time specified therein. In addition, each Borrower

         5.3 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, REPORTS, CERTIFICATES. Deliver to Lender,
each of the financial statements, reports, or other items set forth on Schedule
5.3 at the times specified therein. In addition, Parent agrees that no
Significant Subsidiary of Parent will have a fiscal year different from that of
Parent.

         5.4 INTENTIONALLY OMITTED.

         5.5 INSPECTION. Permit Lender and its duly authorized representatives
or agents to visit any of its properties and inspect any of its assets or books
and records, to examine and make copies of its books and records, and to discuss
its affairs, finances, and accounts with, and to be advised as to the same by,
its officers and employees at such reasonable times and intervals as Lender may
designate and, so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, with reasonable
prior notice to Borrower.

         5.6 MAINTENANCE OF PROPERTIES. Maintain and preserve all of their
properties which are necessary or useful in the proper conduct to their business
in good working order and condition, ordinary wear, tear, and casualty excepted
(and except where the failure to do so could not be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Change), and comply at all times with the provisions of all
material leases to which it is a party as lessee, so as to prevent any loss or
forfeiture thereof or thereunder.

         5.7 TAXES. Cause all assessments and taxes, whether real, personal, or
otherwise, due or payable by, or imposed, levied, or assessed against Borrowers,
their Significant Subsidiaries, or any of their respective assets to be paid in
full, before delinquency or before the expiration of any extension period,
except to the extent that the validity of such assessment or tax shall be the
subject of a Permitted Protest. Borrowers will, and will cause their Significant
Subsidiaries to, make timely payment or deposit of all tax payments and
withholding taxes required of them by applicable laws, including those laws
concerning F.I.C.A., F.U.T.A., state disability, and local, state, and federal
income taxes, and will, upon request, furnish Lender with proof satisfactory to
Lender indicating that the applicable Borrower or Significant Subsidiary of a
Borrower has made such payments or deposits.

         5.8 INSURANCE.

                  (a) At Borrowers' expense, maintain insurance respecting their
and their Significant Subsidiaries' assets wherever located, covering loss or
damage by fire, theft, explosion, and all other hazards and risks as ordinarily
are insured against by other Persons engaged in the same or similar businesses.
Borrowers also shall maintain business interruption, public liability, and
product liability insurance, as well as insurance against larceny, embezzlement,
and criminal misappropriation. All such policies of insurance shall be in such
amounts and with such insurance companies as are reasonably satisfactory to
Lender. Borrowers shall deliver copies of all such policies to Lender with an
endorsement naming Lender as the sole loss payee (under a satisfactory lender's
loss payable endorsement) or additional insured, as appropriate. Each policy of
insurance or endorsement shall contain a clause requiring the insurer to give
not less than 30 days prior written notice to Lender in the event of
cancellation of the policy for any reason whatsoever.

                  (b) Administrative Borrower shall give Lender prompt notice of
any loss exceeding $100,000 covered by such insurance. So long as no Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing, Administrative Borrower shall have the
exclusive right to adjust any losses payable under any such insurance policies
which are less than $100,000. Following the occurrence and during the
continuation of an Event of Default, or in the case of any losses payable under
such insurance exceeding $100,000, Lender shall have the exclusive right to
adjust any losses payable under any such insurance policies, without any
liability to Borrowers whatsoever in respect of such adjustments. Any monies
received as payment for any loss under any insurance policy mentioned above
(other than liability insurance policies) or as payment of any award or
compensation for condemnation or taking by eminent domain, shall be paid over to
Lender to be applied at the option of Lender either to the prepayment of the
Obligations or shall be disbursed to Administrative Borrower under staged
payment terms reasonably satisfactory to Lender for application to the cost of
repairs, replacements, or restorations; provided, however, that, with respect to
any such monies in an aggregate amount during any 12 consecutive month period
not in excess of $100,000, so long as (A) no Default or Event of Default shall
have occurred and is continuing, (B) Borrowers' Excess Availability is greater
than $2,000,000, (C) Administrative Borrower shall have given Lender prior
written notice of the Borrowers or their respective Significant Subsidiaries'
intention to apply such monies to the costs of repairs, replacement, or
restoration of the property which is the subject of the loss, destruction, or
taking by condemnation, (D) the monies are held in a cash collateral account in
which Lender has a perfected first-priority security interest, and (E) Borrowers
or their Significant Subsidiaries complete such repairs, replacements, or
restoration within 180 days after the initial receipt of such monies, Borrowers
shall have the option to apply such monies to the costs of repairs, replacement,
or restoration of the property which is the subject of the loss, destruction, or
taking by condemnation unless and to the extent that such applicable period
shall have expired without such repairs, replacements, or restoration being
made, in which case, any amounts remaining in the cash collateral account shall
be paid to Lender and applied as set forth above.

         5.9 LOCATION OF INVENTORY AND EQUIPMENT. Keep Borrowers' and their
Significant Subsidiaries' Inventory and Equipment (other than vehicles and
Equipment out for repair) only at the locations identified on Schedule 4.5 and
their chief executive offices only at the locations identified on Schedule
4.7(b); provided, however, that Administrative Borrower may amend Schedule 4.5
or Schedule 4.7 so long as such amendment occurs by written notice to Lender not
less than 30 days prior to the date on which such Inventory or Equipment is
moved to such new location or such chief executive office is relocated, so long
as such new location is within the continental United States, and so long as, at
the time of such written notification, the applicable Borrower provides to
Lender a Collateral Access Agreement with respect thereto.

         5.10 COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS. Comply with the requirements of all
applicable laws, rules, regulations, and orders of any Governmental Authority,
other than laws, rules, regulations, and orders the non-compliance with which,
individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in
a Material Adverse Change.

         5.11 LEASES. Pay when due all rents and other amounts payable under any
material leases to which any Borrower or any Significant Subsidiary of a
Borrower is a party or by which any Borrower's or any of its Significant
Subsidiaries' properties and assets are bound, unless such payments are the
subject of a Permitted Protest.

         5.12 EXISTENCE. At all times preserve and keep in full force and effect
each Borrower's and each of its Significant Subsidiaries' valid existence and
good standing and any rights and franchises material to their businesses.

         5.13 ENVIRONMENTAL.

                  (a) Keep any property either owned or operated by any Borrower
or any Subsidiary of a Borrower free of any Environmental Liens or post bonds or
other financial assurances sufficient to satisfy the obligations or liability
evidenced by such Environmental Liens, (b) comply, in all material respects,
with Environmental Laws and provide to Lender documentation of such compliance
which Lender reasonably requests, (c) promptly notify Lender of any release of a

Actions required to abate said release or otherwise to come into compliance with

of its receipt thereof, provide Lender with written notice of any of the
following: (i) notice that an Environmental Lien has been filed against any of
the real or personal property of any Borrower or any Subsidiary of a Borrower,
(ii) commencement of any Environmental Action or notice that an Environmental
Action will be filed against any Borrower or any Subsidiary of a Borrower, and
(iii) notice of a violation, citation, or other administrative order which
reasonably could be expected to result in a Material Adverse Change.

         5.14 DISCLOSURE UPDATES. Promptly and in no event later than 5 Business
Days after obtaining knowledge thereof, notify Lender if any written
information, exhibit, or report furnished to Lender contained, at the time it
was furnished, any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements contained therein not misleading
in light of the circumstances in which made. The foregoing to the contrary
notwithstanding, any notification pursuant to the foregoing provision will not
cure or remedy the effect of the prior untrue statement of a material fact or
omission of any material fact nor shall any such notification have the affect of
amending or, modifying this Agreement or any of the Schedules hereto.

                                       27

documents (including Mortgages with respect to any Real Property of such new
Subsidiary), as well as appropriate financing statements (and with respect to
all property subject to a Mortgage, fixture filings), all in form and substance
satisfactory to Lender (including being sufficient to grant Lender a first
priority Lien (subject to Permitted Liens) in and to the assets of such newly
formed or acquired Significant Subsidiary), (b) provide to Lender a pledge
agreement and appropriate certificates and powers or financing statements,
hypothecating all, or in the case of a Foreign Subsidiary (that would constitute

Subsidiary or first-tier Foreign Subsidiary, in form and substance satisfactory

reasonable judgment, materially impair the prospects of repayment of the
Obligations by Borrowers or materially impair Borrowers' creditworthiness, (ii)
such refinancings, renewals, or extensions do not result in an increase in the

the Indebtedness so refinanced, renewed, or extended or add one or more
Borrowers as liable with respect thereto if such additional Borrowers were not
liable with respect to the original Indebtedness, (iii) such refinancings,

refinanced, renewed, or extended was subordinated in right of payment to the
Obligations, then the terms and conditions of the refinancing, renewal, or

renewed, or extended Indebtedness, and (v) the Indebtedness that is refinanced,
renewed, or extended is not recourse to any Person that is liable on account of

If, however, at any time, the Borrowers' Qualified Cash plus Availability is
less than $6,500,000 (such circumstance is hereinafter referred to as a
"Liquidity Shortfall Event"), then, at the Lender's sole discretion, the EBITDA
covenant shall be adjusted to a monthly test in such amounts as agreed to by the
Lender and the Borrowers based on the most-recent Projections, which testing
period shall commence within 10 Business Days after the Lender notifies the
Administrative Borrower of the occurrence of a Liquidity Shortfall Event and
shall continue until 3 months after such Liquidity Shortfall Event has been
cured by the Borrowers.

                  (b) Make:

                      (i) CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. Capital Expenditures in any

If, however, the amount set forth above for a particular fiscal year exceeds the
actual amount of Capital Expenditures so incurred by the Borrowers in such
fiscal year, then 50% of such excess Capital Expenditures may be carried forward
to the succeeding fiscal year to increase the amount of Capital Expenditures
that may be incurred hereunder in such succeeding fiscal year.

Subsidiary's obligations thereunder;

         7.9 If any warranty, representation, statement, or Record made herein

thereby, except as a result of a disposition of the applicable Collateral in a
transaction permitted under this Agreement; or

reason be declared to be null and void, or the validity or enforceability
thereof shall be contested by any Borrower or any Significant Subsidiary of a
Borrower, or a proceeding shall be commenced by any Borrower or any Significant
Subsidiary of a Borrower, or by any Governmental Authority having jurisdiction

obligation purported to be created under any Loan Document.

8. THE LENDER'S RIGHTS AND REMEDIES.

         8.1 RIGHTS AND REMEDIES. Upon the occurrence, and during the
continuation, of an Event of Default, Lender (at its election but without notice
of its election and without demand) may do any one or more of the following, all
of which are authorized by Borrowers:

                  (a) Declare all or any portion of the Obligations, whether
evidenced by this Agreement, by any of the other Loan Documents, or otherwise,
immediately due and payable;

                  (b) Cease advancing money or extending credit to or for the
benefit of Borrowers under this Agreement, under any of the Loan Documents, or
under any other agreement between Borrowers and Lender;

                  (c) Terminate this Agreement and any of the other Loan
Documents as to any future liability or obligation of Lender, but without
affecting any of the Lender's Liens in the Collateral and without affecting the
Obligations; and

                  (d) Lender shall have all other rights and remedies available
at law or in equity or pursuant to any other Loan Document.

                  The foregoing to the contrary notwithstanding, upon the
occurrence of any Event of Default described in Section 7.4 or Section 7.5, in
addition to the remedies set forth above, without any notice to Borrowers or any
other Person or any act by the Lender, Lender's obligation to extent credit
hereunder shall terminate and the Obligations then outstanding, together with
all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, and all fees and all other amounts due
under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, shall automatically and
immediately become due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest, or
notice of any kind, all of which are expressly waived by Borrowers.

         8.2 REMEDIES CUMULATIVE. The rights and remedies of Lender under this
Agreement, the other Loan Documents, and all other agreements shall be
cumulative. Lender shall have all other rights and remedies not inconsistent
herewith as provided under the Code, by law, or in equity. No exercise by Lender
of one right or remedy shall be deemed an election, and no waiver by Lender of
any Event of Default shall be deemed a continuing waiver. No delay by Lender
shall constitute a waiver, election, or acquiescence by it.

         8.3 BANK PRODUCT PROVIDERS. Each Bank Product Provider shall be deemed
a party hereto for purposes of any reference in any Loan Document with respect
to the Bank Product Providers or the Bank Product Obligations; it being
understood and agreed that the rights and benefits of such Bank Product Provider
under the Loan Documents consist exclusively of such Bank Provider's right to
share in payments and collections out of the Collateral as more fully set forth
herein. In connection with any such distribution of payments and collections,
Lender shall be entitled to assume no amounts are due to any Bank Product
Provider unless such Bank Product Provider has notified Lender in writing of the
amount of any such liability owed to it prior to such distribution.

                                       35
<PAGE>

9. TAXES AND EXPENSES.

                  If any Borrower fails to pay any monies (whether taxes,
assessments, insurance premiums, or, in the case of leased properties or assets,
rents or other amounts payable under such leases) due to third Persons, or fails
to make any deposits or furnish any required proof of payment or deposit, all as
required under the terms of this Agreement, then, unless such payment or deposit
is being contested in good faith by such Borrower, Lender, in its sole
discretion and upon 5-day prior notice to any Borrower, may do any or all of the
following: (a) make payment of the same or any part thereof, (b) set up such
reserves against the Borrowing Base or the Maximum Revolver Amount as Lender
deems necessary to protect Lender from the exposure created by such failure, or
(c) in the case of the failure to comply with Section 5.8 hereof, obtain and
maintain insurance policies of the type described in Section 5.8 and take any
action with respect to such policies as Lender deems prudent. Any such amounts
paid by Lender shall constitute Lender Expenses and any such payments shall not
constitute an agreement by Lender to make similar payments in the future or a
waiver by Lender of any Event of Default under this Agreement. Lender need not
inquire as to, or contest the validity of, any such expense, tax, or Lien and
the receipt of the usual official notice for the payment thereof shall be
conclusive evidence that the same was validly due and owing.

10. WAIVERS; INDEMNIFICATION.

         10.1 DEMAND; PROTEST. Each Borrower waives demand, protest, notice of
protest, notice of default or dishonor, notice of payment and nonpayment,
nonpayment at maturity, release, compromise, settlement, extension, or renewal
of documents, instruments, chattel paper, and guarantees at any time held by
Lender on which any such Borrower may in any way be liable.

         10.2 LENDER'S LIABILITY FOR BORROWER COLLATERAL. Each Borrower hereby
agrees that: (a) so long as Lender complies with its obligations, if any, under
the Code, Lender shall not in any way or manner be liable or responsible for:
(i) the safekeeping of the Borrower Collateral, (ii) any loss or damage thereto
occurring or arising in any manner or fashion from any cause, (iii) any
diminution in the value thereof, or (iv) any act or default of any carrier,
warehouseman, bailee, forwarding agency, or other Person, and (b) all risk of
loss, damage, or destruction of the Borrower Collateral shall be borne by
Borrowers.

         10.3 INDEMNIFICATION. Each Borrower shall pay, indemnify, defend, and
hold the Lender-Related Persons and each Participant (each, an "Indemnified
Person") harmless (to the fullest extent permitted by law) from and against any
and all claims, demands, suits, actions, investigations, proceedings, and
damages, and all reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements and other costs and
expenses actually incurred in connection therewith or in connection with the
enforcement of this indemnification (as and when they are incurred and
irrespective of whether suit is brought), at any time asserted against, imposed
upon, or incurred by any of them (a) in connection with or as a result of or
related to the execution, delivery or enforcement (including any restructuring
or workout with respect hereto) of this Agreement, any of the other Loan
Documents, or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, and (b) with
respect to any investigation, litigation, or proceeding related to this
Agreement, any other Loan Document, or the use of the proceeds of the credit
provided hereunder (irrespective of whether any Indemnified Person is a party
thereto), or any act, omission, event, or circumstance in any manner related
thereto (all the foregoing, collectively, the "Indemnified Liabilities"). The
foregoing to the contrary notwithstanding, Borrowers shall have no obligation to
any Indemnified Person under this Section 10.3 with respect to any Indemnified
Liability that a court of competent jurisdiction finally determines to have
resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnified
Person. This provision shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the
repayment of the Obligations. If any Indemnified Person makes any payment to any
other Indemnified Person with respect to an Indemnified Liability as to which
Borrowers were required to indemnify the Indemnified Person receiving such
payment, the Indemnified Person making such payment is entitled to be
indemnified and reimbursed by Borrowers with respect thereto. WITHOUT
LIMITATION, THE FOREGOING INDEMNITY SHALL APPLY TO EACH INDEMNIFIED PERSON WITH
RESPECT TO INDEMNIFIED LIABILITIES WHICH IN WHOLE OR IN PART ARE CAUSED BY OR
ARISE OUT OF ANY NEGLIGENT ACT OR OMISSION OF SUCH INDEMNIFIED PERSON OR OF ANY
OTHER PERSON.

13. ASSIGNMENTS AND PARTICIPATIONS; SUCCESSORS.

         13.1 ASSIGNMENTS AND PARTICIPATIONS.

                  (a) Lender may assign and delegate to one or more assignees
(each an "Assignee") that are Eligible Transferees all, or any ratable part of
all, of the Obligations and the other rights and obligations of Lender hereunder
and under the other Loan Documents, in a minimum amount of $5,000,000; provided,
however, that Borrowers may continue to deal solely and directly with Lender in
connection with the interest so assigned to an Assignee until (i) written notice
of such assignment, together with payment instructions, addresses, and related
information with respect to the Assignee, have been given to Administrative
Borrower by Lender and the Assignee, and (ii) Lender and its Assignee have
delivered to Borrower an Assignment and Acceptance. Anything contained herein to
the contrary notwithstanding, the Assignee need not be an Eligible Transferee if
such assignment is in connection with any merger, consolidation, sale, transfer,
or other disposition of all or any substantial portion of the business or loan
portfolio of the assigning Lender.

                  (b) From and after the date that Lender provides
Administrative Borrower with such written notice and an executed Assignment and
Acceptance, (i) the Assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the
extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant
to such Assignment and Acceptance, shall have the rights and obligations of
Lender under the Loan Documents, and (ii) Lender shall, to the extent that
rights and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents have been
assigned by it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, relinquish its rights
(except with respect to Section 10.3 hereof) and be released from any future
obligations under this Agreement (and in the case of an Assignment and
Acceptance covering all or the remaining portion of an assigning Lender's rights
and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, Lender shall
cease to be a party hereto and thereto), and such assignment shall effect a
novation between Borrowers and the Assignee; provided, however, that nothing
contained herein shall release Lender from obligations that survive the
termination of this Agreement, including such assigning Lender's obligations
under Section 15.7 of this Agreement.

                                       39
<PAGE>

                  (c) By executing and delivering an Assignment and Acceptance,
the assigning Lender thereunder and the Assignee thereunder confirm to and agree
with each other and the other parties hereto as follows: (1) other than as
provided in such Assignment and Acceptance, such assigning Lender makes no
representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to any
statements, warranties or representations made in or in connection with this
Agreement or the execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness,
sufficiency or value of this Agreement or any other Loan Document furnished
pursuant thereto, (2) such assigning Lender makes no representation or warranty
and assumes no responsibility with respect to the financial condition of any
Borrower or the performance or observance by any Borrower of any of its
obligations under this Agreement or any other Loan Document furnished pursuant
hereto, (3) such Assignee confirms that it has received a copy of this
Agreement, together with such other documents and information as it has deemed
appropriate to make its own credit analysis and decision to enter into such
Assignment and Acceptance, (4) such Assignee will, independently and without
reliance upon such assigning Lender, and based on such documents and information
as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit
decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement, and (5) such
Assignee agrees that it will perform all of the obligations which by the terms
of this Agreement are required to be performed by it as a Lender.

                  (d) Immediately upon Borrower's receipt of the fully executed
Assignment and Acceptance, this Agreement shall be deemed to be amended to the
extent, but only to the extent, necessary to reflect the addition of the
Assignee and the resulting adjustment of the rights and duties of Lender arising
therefrom.

                  (e) Lender may at any time sell to one or more commercial
banks, financial institutions, or other Persons (a "Participant") participating
interests in Obligations and the other rights and interests of Lender hereunder
and under the other Loan Documents; provided, however, that (i) Lender shall
remain the "Lender" for all purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents and the Participant receiving the participating interest in the
Obligations and the other rights and interests of Lender hereunder shall not
constitute a "Lender" hereunder or under the other Loan Documents and Lender's
obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) Lender shall
remain solely responsible for the performance of such obligations, (iii)
Borrowers and Lender shall continue to deal solely and directly with each other
in connection with Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents, (iv) Lender shall not transfer or grant any participating
interest under which the Participant has the right to approve any amendment to,
or any consent or waiver with respect to, this Agreement or any other Loan
Document, except to the extent such amendment to, or consent or waiver with
respect to this Agreement or of any other Loan Document would (A) extend the
final maturity date of the Obligations hereunder in which such Participant is
participating, (B) reduce the interest rate applicable to the Obligations
hereunder in which such Participant is participating, (C) release all or
substantially all of the Collateral or guaranties (except to the extent
expressly provided herein or in any of the Loan Documents) supporting the
Obligations hereunder in which such Participant is participating, (D) postpone
the payment of, or reduce the amount of, the interest or fees payable to such
Participant through Lender, or (E) change the amount or due dates of scheduled
principal repayments or prepayments or premiums, and (v) all amounts payable by
Borrowers hereunder shall be determined as if Lender had not sold such
participation, except that, if amounts outstanding under this Agreement are due
and unpaid, or shall have been declared or shall have become due and payable
upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, each Participant shall be deemed to
have the right of set-off in respect of its participating interest in amounts
owing under this Agreement to the same extent as if the amount of its
participating interest were owing directly to it as a Lender under this
Agreement. The rights of any Participant only shall be derivative through Lender
and no Participant shall have any rights under this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents or any direct rights as to Borrowers, the Collections of Borrowers or
their Subsidiaries, the Collateral, or otherwise in respect of the Obligations.
No Participant shall have the right to participate directly in the making of
decisions by Lender.

                                       40
<PAGE>

                  (f) In connection with any such assignment or participation or
proposed assignment or participation, Lender may, subject to the provisions of
Section 15.8, disclose all documents and information which it now or hereafter
may have relating to Borrowers and their Subsidiaries and their respective
businesses.

                  (g) Any other provision in this Agreement notwithstanding,
Lender may at any time create a security interest in, or pledge, all or any
portion of its rights under and interest in this Agreement in favor of any
Federal Reserve Bank in accordance with Regulation A of the Federal Reserve Bank
or U.S. Treasury Regulation 31 CFR ss.203.24, and such Federal Reserve Bank may
enforce such pledge or security interest in any manner permitted under
applicable law.

         13.2 SUCCESSORS. The Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of
the respective successors and assigns of each of the parties; provided, however,
that Borrowers may not assign this Agreement or any rights or duties hereunder
without Lender's prior written consent and any prohibited assignment shall be
absolutely void ab initio. No consent to assignment by Lender shall release any
Borrower from its Obligations. Lender may assign this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents and its rights and duties hereunder and thereunder pursuant to
Section 13.1 hereof and, except as expressly required pursuant to Section 13.1
hereof, no consent or approval by any Borrower is required in connection with
any such assignment.

14. AMENDMENTS; WAIVERS.

         14.1 AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS. No amendment or waiver of any provision of
this Agreement or any other Loan Document (other than Bank Product Agreements),
and no consent with respect to any departure by Borrowers therefrom, shall be
effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by Lender and
Administrative Borrower (on behalf of all Borrowers) and then any such waiver or
consent shall be effective, but only in the specific instance and for the
specific purpose for which given.

         14.2 NO WAIVERS; CUMULATIVE REMEDIES. No failure by Lender to exercise
any right, remedy, or option under this Agreement or, any other Loan Document,
or delay by Lender in exercising the same, will operate as a waiver thereof. No
waiver by Lender will be effective unless it is in writing, and then only to the
extent specifically stated. No waiver by Lender on any occasion shall affect or
diminish Lender's rights thereafter to require strict performance by Borrowers
of any provision of this Agreement. Lender's rights under this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents will be cumulative and not exclusive of any other right or
remedy that Lender may have.

                                       41
<PAGE>

15. GENERAL PROVISIONS.

         15.1 EFFECTIVENESS. The Agreement shall be binding and deemed effective
when executed by Borrowers and Lender.

         15.2 SECTION HEADINGS. Headings and numbers have been set forth herein
for convenience only. Unless the contrary is compelled by the context,
everything contained in each Section applies equally to this entire Agreement.

         15.3 INTERPRETATION. Neither this Agreement nor any uncertainty or
ambiguity herein shall be construed against Lender or Borrowers, whether under
any rule of construction or otherwise. On the contrary, this Agreement has been
reviewed by all parties and shall be construed and interpreted according to the
ordinary meaning of the words used so as to accomplish fairly the purposes and
intentions of all parties hereto.

         15.4 SEVERABILITY OF PROVISIONS. Each provision of this Agreement shall
be severable from every other provision of this Agreement for the purpose of
determining the legal enforceability of any specific provision.

         15.5 WITHHOLDING TAXES. All payments made by any Borrower hereunder or
under any note or other Loan Document will be made without setoff, counterclaim,
or other defense. In addition, all such payments will be made free and clear of,
and without deduction or withholding for, any present or future Taxes, and in
the event any deduction or withholding of Taxes is required, each Borrower shall
comply with the penultimate sentence of this Section 15.5. "Taxes" shall mean,
any taxes, levies, imposts, duties, fees, assessments or other charges of
whatever nature now or hereafter imposed by any jurisdiction or by any political
subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein with respect to such payments
(but excluding any tax imposed by any jurisdiction or by any political
subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein measured by or based on the
net income or net profits of Lender) and all interest, penalties or similar
liabilities with respect thereto. If any Taxes are so levied or imposed, each
Borrower agrees to pay the full amount of such Taxes and such additional amounts
as may be necessary so that every payment of all amounts due under this
Agreement, any note, or Loan Document, including any amount paid pursuant to
this Section 15.5 after withholding or deduction for or on account of any Taxes,
will not be less than the amount provided for herein; provided, however, that
Borrowers shall not be required to increase any such amounts if the increase in
such amount payable results from Lender's own willful misconduct or gross
negligence (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction). Each
Borrower will furnish to Lender as promptly as possible after the date the
payment of any Tax is due pursuant to applicable law certified copies of tax
receipts evidencing such payment by any Borrower.

         15.6 COUNTERPARTS; ELECTRONIC EXECUTION. The Agreement may be executed
in any number of counterparts and by different parties on separate counterparts,
each of which, when executed and delivered, shall be deemed to be an original,
and all of which, when taken together, shall constitute but one and the same
Agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart of this Agreement by
telefacsimile or other electronic method of transmission shall be equally as
effective as delivery of an original executed counterpart of this Agreement. Any
party delivering an executed counterpart of this Agreement by telefacsimile or
other electronic method of transmission also shall deliver an original executed
counterpart of this Agreement but the failure to deliver an original executed
counterpart shall not affect the validity, enforceability, and binding effect of
this Agreement. The foregoing shall apply to each other Loan Document mutatis
mutandis.

                                       42
<PAGE>

         15.7 REVIVAL AND REINSTATEMENT OF OBLIGATIONS. If the incurrence or
payment of the Obligations by any Borrower or the transfer to Lender of any
property should for any reason subsequently be declared to be void or voidable
under any state or federal law relating to creditors' rights, including
provisions of the Bankruptcy Code relating to fraudulent conveyances,
preferences, or other voidable or recoverable payments of money or transfers of
property (collectively, a "Voidable Transfer"), and if Lender is required to
repay or restore, in whole or in part, any such Voidable Transfer, or elects to
do so upon the reasonable advice of its counsel, then, as to any such Voidable
Transfer, or the amount thereof that Lender is required or elects to repay or
restore, and as to all reasonable costs, expenses, and attorneys fees of Lender
related thereto, the liability of Borrowers automatically shall be revived,
reinstated, and restored and shall exist as though such Voidable Transfer had
never been made.

         15.8 CONFIDENTIALITY.

                  Lender agrees that material, non-public information regarding
Borrowers and their Subsidiaries, their operations, assets, and existing and
contemplated business plans shall be treated by Lender in a confidential manner,
and shall not be disclosed by Lender to Persons who are not parties to this
Agreement, except: (a) to attorneys for and other advisors, accountants,
auditors, and consultants to Lender, (b) to Subsidiaries and Affiliates of
Lender (including the Bank Product Providers), provided that any such Subsidiary
or Affiliate shall have agreed to receive such information hereunder subject to
the terms of this Section 15.8, (c) as may be required by statute, decision, or
judicial or administrative order, rule, or regulation, (d) as may be agreed to
in advance by Administrative Borrower or its Subsidiaries or as requested or
required by any Governmental Authority pursuant to any subpoena or other legal
process, (e) as to any such information that is or becomes generally available
to the public (other than as a result of prohibited disclosure by Lender), (f)
in connection with any assignment, prospective assignment, sale, prospective
sale, participation or prospective participations, or pledge or prospective
pledge of Lender's interest under this Agreement, provided that any such
assignee, prospective assignee, purchaser, prospective purchaser, participant,
prospective participant, pledgee, or prospective pledgee shall have agreed in
writing to receive such information hereunder subject to the terms of this
Section, and (g) in connection with any litigation or other adversary proceeding
involving parties hereto which such litigation or adversary proceeding involves
claims related to the rights or duties of such parties under this Agreement or
the other Loan Documents. The provisions of this Section 15.8 shall survive for
2 years after the payment in full of the Obligations.

         15.9 INTEGRATION. The Agreement, together with the other Loan
Documents, reflects the entire understanding of the parties with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby and shall not be contradicted or qualified by
any other agreement, oral or written, before the date hereof.

                                       43

         15.10 PARENT AS AGENT FOR BORROWERS. Each Borrower hereby irrevocably
appoints Parent as the borrowing agent and attorney-in-fact for all Borrowers
(the "Administrative Borrower") which appointment shall remain in full force and
effect unless and until Lender shall have received prior written notice signed
by each Borrower that such appointment has been revoked and that another
Borrower has been appointed Administrative Borrower. Each Borrower hereby
irrevocably appoints and authorizes the Administrative Borrower (i) to provide
Lender with all notices with respect to Advances and Letters of Credit obtained
for the benefit of any Borrower and all other notices and instructions under
this Agreement and (ii) to take such action as the Administrative Borrower deems
appropriate on its behalf to obtain Advances and Letters of Credit and to
exercise such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement. It is understood that the handling of the Loan
Account and Collateral of Borrowers in a combined fashion, as more fully set
forth herein, is done solely as an accommodation to Borrowers in order to
utilize the collective borrowing powers of Borrowers in the most efficient and
economical manner and at their request, and that Lender shall not incur
liability to any Borrower as a result hereof. Each Borrower expects to derive
benefit, directly or indirectly, from the handling of the Loan Account and the
Collateral in a combined fashion since the successful operation of each Borrower
is dependent on the continued successful performance of the integrated group. To
induce Lender to do so, and in consideration thereof, each Borrower hereby
jointly and severally agrees to indemnify Lender harmless against any and all
liability, expense, loss or claim of damage or injury, made against Lender by
any Borrower or by any third party whosoever, arising from or incurred by reason
of (a) the handling of the Loan Account and Collateral of Borrowers as herein
provided, (b) Lender's relying on any instructions of the Administrative
Borrower, or (c) any other action taken by Lender hereunder or under the other
Loan Documents, except that Borrowers will have no liability to any
Lender-Related Person under this Section 15.10 with respect to any liability
that has been finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have
resulted solely from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such
Lender-Related Person.

Lender's Liens in and to the Collateral shall attach to all Collateral without
further act on the part of Lender or the Debtor. Anything contained in this
Agreement or any other Loan Document to the contrary notwithstanding, except for
Permitted Dispositions, the Debtor has no authority, express or implied, to
dispose of any item or portion of the Collateral.

                          2.2 NEGOTIABLE COLLATERAL. In the event that any
Collateral, including proceeds, is evidenced by or consists of Negotiable
Collateral, and if and to the extent that perfection or priority of Lender's
security interest is dependent on or enhanced by possession, the Debtor,
promptly upon the request of Lender, shall endorse and assign such Negotiable
Collateral to Lender and deliver physical possession of such Negotiable
Collateral to Lender.

                          2.3 COLLECTION OF ACCOUNTS, GENERAL INTANGIBLES,
NEGOTIABLE COLLATERAL. At any time after the occurrence and during the
continuation of an Event of Default, Lender or its designee may (a) notify
Account Debtors of the Debtor that the Accounts, chattel paper, or General
Intangibles have been assigned to Lender or that Lender has a security interest
therein, or (b) collect the Accounts, chattel paper, or General Intangibles
directly and charge the reasonable collection costs and expenses to the Loan
Account.

                          2.4 DELIVERY OF ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED.

                              (a) The Debtor authorizes Lender to file any
financing statement necessary or desirable to effectuate the transactions
contemplated by the Loan Documents, and any continuation statement or amendment
with respect thereto, in any appropriate filing office without the signature of
the Debtor where permitted by applicable law and describing the Collateral in
the same manner as described herein.

                              (b) At any time upon the request of Lender, the
Debtor shall execute and deliver to Lender, any and all financing statements,
original financing statements in lieu of continuation statements, fixture
filings, security agreements, pledges, assignments, endorsements of certificates
of title, and all other documents (the "Additional Documents") that Lender may
request in its Permitted Discretion, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Lender, to perfect and continue perfection or better perfect the
Lender's Liens in the Collateral (whether now owned or hereafter arising or
acquired), and in order to fully consummate all of the transactions contemplated
hereby and under the other Loan Documents. If Debtor or its Subsidiaries acquire
any material commercial tort claims after the date hereof, Debtor shall promptly
(but in any event within 3 Business Days after such acquisition) deliver to
Secured Party a written description of such material commercial tort claim and
shall deliver a written agreement, in form and substance satisfactory to Secured
Party, pursuant to which the Debtor or its Subsidiary shall pledge and
collaterally assign all of its right, title and interest in and to such material
commercial tort claim to Secured Party, as security for the Secured Obligations.

                          2.5 POWER OF ATTORNEY. The Debtor hereby irrevocably
appoints Lender (and any of Lender's officers, employees, or agents designated
by Lender) as the Debtor's attorney-in-fact, with power to: (a) if the Debtor
refuses to, or fails timely to execute and deliver any of the documents
described in Section 2.4, sign the name of the Debtor on any of the documents
described in Section 2.4; (b) at any time that an Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing, sign the Debtor's name on any invoice or bill of lading
relating to the Collateral, drafts against Account Debtors, or notices to
Account Debtors; (c) send requests for verification of Accounts; (d) endorse the
Debtor's name on any Collection item that may come into Lender's possession; (e)
at any time that an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, make,
settle, and adjust all claims under the Debtor's policies of insurance and make
all determinations and decisions with respect to such policies of insurance
(other than workers' compensation); and (f) at any time that an Event of Default
has occurred and is continuing, settle and adjust disputes and claims respecting
the Accounts, chattel paper, or General Intangibles directly with Account
Debtors, for amounts and upon terms which Lender determines to be reasonable,
and Lender may cause to be executed and delivered any documents and releases
which Lender determines to be necessary. The appointment of Lender as the
Debtor's attorney, and each and every one of Lender's rights and powers, being
coupled with an interest, is irrevocable until, and shall terminate when, all of
the Secured Obligations have been fully and finally repaid and performed and
Lender's obligation to extend credit under the Credit Agreement is terminated.

                          2.7 CONTROL AGREEMENT. The Debtor agrees that it will
not transfer assets out of any Securities Account or Deposit Account other than
as permitted under the Credit Agreement. No arrangement contemplated hereby or
by any Control Agreement in respect of any Securities Account, Deposit Account,
or other Investment Property shall be modified by the Debtor without the prior
written consent of Lender. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an
Event of Default, Lender may notify any bank or securities intermediary to
liquidate the applicable Deposit Account or Securities Account or any related
Investment Property maintained or held thereby and remit the proceeds thereof to
the Lender's Account.

                          2.8 RELEASE OF SECURITY INTEREST. Upon the payment in
full of all Secured Obligations or the cancellation or termination of the
commitments and any other contingent obligation included in the Secured
Obligations, the security interest granted hereby shall terminate hereunder and
all rights to the Collateral shall revert and be deemed reassigned to the
Debtor. Upon any such termination, the Lender shall, at the Debtor's request and
expense, execute and deliver to the Debtor such documents as the Debtor shall
reasonably request to evidence such termination and/or reassignment, without
recourse, representation or warranty of any kind. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
immediately prior to the Infocrossing Stock Sale and the Domain Name Sales, the
Lender agrees to release its security interest in that portion of the Collateral
constituting the Infocrossing Stock and such relevant domain names sold in the
Domain Name Sales in order to permit the Debtor to consummate such transactions
subject in all respects to the terms and provisions contained in the Credit
Agreement.

                  3. LENDER'S RIGHTS AND REMEDIES.

                          3.1 RIGHTS AND REMEDIES. Upon the occurrence and
during the continuance of an Event of Default, the security hereby constituted
shall become enforceable and, in addition to all other rights and remedies
available to Lender as provided hereafter, Lender may, at its election, without
notice of its election and without demand, do any one or more of the following,
all of which are authorized by the Debtor:

                              (a) Proceed directly and at once, without notice,
against the Debtor to collect and recover the full amount or any portion of the
Secured Obligations, without first proceeding against any other Borrower, or
against any security or collateral for the Secured Obligations;

                              (b) Without notice to the Debtor and regardless of
the acceptance of any security or collateral for the payment hereof, appropriate
and apply toward the payment of the Secured Obligations (i) any indebtedness due
or to become due from Lender to the Debtor and (ii) any moneys, credits or other
property belonging to the Debtor at any time held by or coming into the
possession of Lender;

                                      -6-
<PAGE>

                              (c) Exercise in respect of the Collateral, in
addition to other rights and remedies provided for herein or otherwise available
to it, all the rights and remedies available to it at law (including those of a
secured party under the Code) or in equity;

                              (d) Settle or adjust disputes and claims directly
with Account Debtors for amounts and upon terms which Lender considers
advisable, and in such cases, Lender will credit the Loan Account with only the
net amounts received by Lender in payment of such disputed Accounts after
deducting all Lender Expenses incurred or expended in connection therewith;

                              (e) Without notice or demand upon the Debtor, make
such payments and do such acts as Lender considers necessary or reasonable to
protect its security interest in the Collateral. The Debtor agrees to make the
Collateral available to Lender as Lender may designate. The Debtor authorizes
Lender to enter the premises where the Collateral is located, to take and
maintain possession of the Collateral, or any part of it, and to pay, purchase,
contest, or compromise any encumbrance, charge, or lien which in Lender's
determination appears to be prior or superior to its security interest and to
pay all expenses incurred in connection therewith. With respect to any of the
Debtor' owned premises, the Debtor hereby grants Lender a license to enter into
possession of such premises and to occupy the same, without charge, in order to
exercise any of Lender's rights or remedies provided herein, at law, in equity,
or otherwise;

                              (f) Ship, reclaim, recover, store, finish,
maintain, repair, prepare for sale, advertise for sale, and sell (in the manner
provided for herein) the Collateral. Lender is hereby granted a license or other
right to use, without charge, the Debtor's labels, patents, copyrights, rights
of use of any name, trade secrets, trade names, trademarks, service marks, and
advertising matter, or any property of a similar nature, as it pertains to the
Collateral, in completing production of advertising for sale and selling any
Collateral, and the Debtor's rights under all licenses and all franchise
agreements shall inure to Lender's benefit;

                              (g) Sell all or any part of the Collateral at
either a public or private sale, or both, by way of one or more contracts or
transactions, for cash or on terms, in such manner and at such places (including
the Debtor's premises) as Lender determines is commercially reasonable. It is
not necessary that the Collateral be present at any such sale;

                                      -7-
<PAGE>

                              (h) Lender shall give notice of the disposition of
the Collateral as follows:

                                  (i) Lender shall give the Debtor a notice in
                              writing of the time and place of public sale, or,
                              if the sale is a private sale or some other
                              disposition other than a public sale is to be made
                              of the Collateral, then the time on or after which
                              the private sale or other disposition is to be
                              made; and

                                  (ii) The notice shall be personally delivered
                              or mailed, postage prepaid, to the Debtor as
                              provided in Section 6, at least ten (10) days
                              before the earliest time of disposition set forth
                              in the notice; no notice needs to be given prior
                              to the disposition of any portion of the
                              Collateral that is perishable or threatens to
                              decline speedily in value or that is of a type
                              customarily sold on a recognized market;

                              (i) Lender may credit bid and purchase at any
public sale;

                              (j) Lender may seek the appointment of a receiver
or keeper to take possession of all or any portion of the Collateral or to
operate same and, to the maximum extent permitted by law, may seek the
appointment of such a receiver or keeper without the requirement of prior notice
or a hearing;

                              (k) Lender, on behalf of the Lender and the Bank
Product Providers, shall have all other rights and remedies available at law or
in equity or pursuant to any other Loan Document; and

                              (l) Any deficiency that exists after disposition
of the Collateral as provided above will be paid immediately by the Debtor. Any
excess will be returned, without interest and subject to the rights of third
Persons, by Lender to the Debtor.

                          3.2 REMEDIES CUMULATIVE. Lender's and the Bank Product
Providers' rights and remedies under this Agreement, the other Loan Documents,
and all other agreements shall be cumulative. The Lender and the Bank Product
Providers shall have all other rights and remedies not inconsistent herewith as
provided under the Code, by law, or in equity. No exercise by Lender of one
right or remedy shall be deemed an election, and no waiver by the Lender or the
Bank Product Providers of any Event of Default on the Debtor's part shall be
deemed a continuing waiver. No delay by the Lender or the Bank Product Providers
shall constitute a waiver, election, or acquiescence by it.

                  4. INTENTIONALLY OMITTED.

                  5. WAIVERS; INDEMNIFICATION.

                          5.1 DEMAND; PROTEST; ETC. Except as otherwise

release, compromise, settlement, extension, or renewal of accounts, documents,
instruments, chattel paper, and guarantees at any time held by the Lender or the
Bank Product Providers, on which the Debtor may in any way be liable.

                          5.2 LIABILITY FOR COLLATERAL. So long as the Lender
and the Bank Product Providers comply with their obligations under the Code and
no willful misconduct or gross negligence occurs, Lender shall not in any way or
manner be liable or responsible for: (a) the safekeeping of the Collateral; (b)
any loss or damage thereto occurring or arising in any manner or fashion from
any cause; (c) any diminution in the value thereof; or (d) any act or default of
any carrier, warehouseman, bailee, forwarding agency, or other Person. All risk
of loss, damage, or destruction of the Collateral shall be borne by the Debtor.

                          5.3 INDEMNIFICATION. The Debtor agrees to defend,

Person, and (b) all losses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
disbursements) in any way suffered, incurred, or paid by the Lender or the Bank
Product Providers as a result of or in any way arising out of this Agreement,

have any obligation under this Section 5.3 with respect to any Indemnified
Liability that a court of competent jurisdiction finally determines to have

Person. This provision shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

Lender shall be in writing and shall be mailed, sent or delivered in accordance
with the Credit Agreement and all notices and other communications hereunder to

LENDER AGREE THAT THE PROVISIONS IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH RESPECT TO CHOICE
OF LAW AND VENUE AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER ARE APPLICABLE TO THIS AGREEMENT AS IF
FULLY SET FORTH HEREIN.

deemed effective when executed by the Debtor and accepted and executed by
Lender.

                          8.2 SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. This Agreement shall bind
and inure to the benefit of the respective successors and assigns of each of the
parties; provided, however, that the Debtor may not assign this Agreement or any
rights or duties hereunder without Lender's prior written consent and any
prohibited assignment shall be absolutely void. No consent to an assignment by
Lender shall release the Debtor from its Secured Obligations. Subject to the
terms contained in Section 13 of the Credit Agreement, Lender may assign this
Agreement and its rights and duties hereunder.

context, everything contained in each section applies equally to this entire
Agreement.

                          8.4 INTERPRETATION. Neither this Agreement nor any
uncertainty or ambiguity herein shall be construed or interpreted against the

                          8.7 COUNTERPARTS; TELEFACSIMILE EXECUTION. This
Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties
on separate counterparts, each of which, when executed and delivered, shall be
deemed to be an original, and all of which, when taken together, shall
constitute but one and the same Agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart
of this Agreement by telefacsimile shall be equally as effective as delivery of
an original executed counterpart of this Agreement. Any party delivering an
executed counterpart of this Agreement by telefacsimile also shall deliver an

incurrence or payment of the Secured Obligations by the Debtor or the transfer
by the Debtor to Lender of any property of the Debtor should for any reason
subsequently be declared to be void or voidable under any state or federal law
relating to creditors' rights, including provisions of the Bankruptcy Code
relating to fraudulent conveyances, preferences, and other voidable or
recoverable payments of money or transfers of property (collectively, a
"Voidable Transfer"), and if Lender is required to repay or restore, in whole or
in part, any such Voidable Transfer, or elects to do so upon the reasonable
advice of its counsel, then, as to any such Voidable Transfer, or the amount
thereof that Lender is required or elects to repay or restore, and as to all
reasonable costs, expenses, and attorneys' fees of Lender related thereto, the
liability of the Debtor automatically shall be revived, reinstated, and restored
and shall exist as though such Voidable Transfer had never been made.

exhibits attached to this Agreement shall be deemed incorporated herein by
reference.

                  2. CREATION OF SECURITY INTEREST.

                     2.1 GRANT OF SECURITY INTEREST. The Debtor hereby grants to
Lender, for the benefit of the Lender and the Bank Product Providers, a security
interest in all of its right, title, and interest in all currently existing and
hereafter acquired or arising Collateral in order to secure prompt repayment of
any and all of the Secured Obligations in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the Loan Documents and in order to secure prompt performance by
the Debtor of the Debtor's covenants and duties under the Loan Documents.
Lender's Liens in and to the Collateral shall attach to all Collateral without
further act on the part of Lender or the Debtor. Anything contained in this
Agreement or any other Loan Document to the contrary notwithstanding, except for
Permitted Dispositions, the Debtor has no authority, express or implied, to
dispose of any item or portion of the Collateral.

                     2.2 NEGOTIABLE COLLATERAL. In the event that any
Collateral, including proceeds, is evidenced by or consists of Negotiable
Collateral, and if and to the extent that perfection or priority of Lender's
security interest is dependent on or enhanced by possession, the Debtor,
promptly upon the request of Lender, shall endorse and assign such Negotiable
Collateral to Lender and deliver physical possession of such Negotiable
Collateral to Lender.

                     2.3 COLLECTION OF ACCOUNTS, GENERAL INTANGIBLES, NEGOTIABLE
COLLATERAL. At any time after the occurrence and during the continuation of an
Event of Default, Lender or its designee may (a) notify Account Debtors of the
Debtor that the Accounts, chattel paper, or General Intangibles have been
assigned to Lender or that Lender has a security interest therein, or (b)
collect the Accounts, chattel paper, or General Intangibles directly and charge
the reasonable collection costs and expenses to the Loan Account.

                     2.4 DELIVERY OF ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED.

                         (a) The Debtor authorizes Lender to file any financing
statement necessary or desirable to effectuate the transactions contemplated by
the Loan Documents, and any continuation statement or amendment with respect
thereto, in any appropriate filing office without the signature of the Debtor
where permitted by applicable law and describing the Collateral in the same
manner as described herein.

                         (b) At any time upon the request of Lender, the Debtor
shall execute and deliver to Lender, any and all financing statements, original
financing statements in lieu of continuation statements, fixture filings,
security agreements, pledges, assignments, endorsements of certificates of
title, and all other documents (the "Additional Documents") that Lender may
request in its Permitted Discretion, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Lender, to perfect and continue perfection or better perfect the
Lender's Liens in the Collateral (whether now owned or hereafter arising or
acquired), and in order to fully consummate all of the transactions contemplated
hereby and under the other Loan Documents. If Debtor or its Subsidiaries acquire
any material commercial tort claims after the date hereof, Debtor shall promptly
(but in any event within 3 Business Days after such acquisition) deliver to
Secured Party a written description of such material commercial tort claim and
shall deliver a written agreement, in form and substance satisfactory to Secured
Party, pursuant to which the Debtor or its Subsidiary shall pledge and
collaterally assign all of its right, title and interest in and to such material
commercial tort claim to Secured Party, as security for the Secured Obligations.

                     2.5 POWER OF ATTORNEY. The Debtor hereby irrevocably
appoints Lender (and any of Lender's officers, employees, or agents designated
by Lender) as the Debtor's attorney-in-fact, with power to: (a) if the Debtor
refuses to, or fails timely to execute and deliver any of the documents
described in Section 2.4, sign the name of the Debtor on any of the documents
described in Section 2.4; (b) at any time that an Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing, sign the Debtor's name on any invoice or bill of lading
relating to the Collateral, drafts against Account Debtors, or notices to
Account Debtors; (c) send requests for verification of Accounts; (d) endorse the
Debtor's name on any Collection item that may come into Lender's possession; (e)
at any time that an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, make,
settle, and adjust all claims under the Debtor's policies of insurance and make
all determinations and decisions with respect to such policies of insurance
(other than workers' compensation); and (f) at any time that an Event of Default
has occurred and is continuing, settle and adjust disputes and claims respecting
the Accounts, chattel paper, or General Intangibles directly with Account
Debtors, for amounts and upon terms which Lender determines to be reasonable,
and Lender may cause to be executed and delivered any documents and releases
which Lender determines to be necessary. The appointment of Lender as the
Debtor's attorney, and each and every one of Lender's rights and powers, being
coupled with an interest, is irrevocable until, and shall terminate when, all of
the Secured Obligations have been fully and finally repaid and performed and
Lender's obligation to extend credit under the Credit Agreement is terminated.

                     2.6 INTENTIONALLY OMITTED.

                     2.7 CONTROL AGREEMENT. The Debtor agrees that it will not
transfer assets out of any Securities Account or Deposit Account other than as
permitted under the Credit Agreement. No arrangement contemplated hereby or by
any Control Agreement in respect of any Securities Account, Deposit Account, or
other Investment Property shall be modified by the Debtor without the prior
written consent of Lender. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an
Event of Default, Lender may notify any bank or securities intermediary to
liquidate the applicable Deposit Account or Securities Account or any related
Investment Property maintained or held thereby and remit the proceeds thereof to
the Lender's Account.

                     2.8 RELEASE OF SECURITY INTEREST. Upon the payment in full
of all Secured Obligations or the cancellation or termination of the commitments
and any other contingent obligation included in the Secured Obligations, the
security interest granted hereby shall terminate hereunder and all rights to the
Collateral shall revert and be deemed reassigned to the Debtor. Upon any such
termination, the Lender shall, at the Debtor's request and expense, execute and
deliver to the Debtor such documents as the Debtor shall reasonably request to
evidence such termination and/or reassignment, without recourse, representation
or warranty of any kind.

                  3. LENDER'S RIGHTS AND REMEDIES.

                     3.1 RIGHTS AND REMEDIES. Upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default, the security hereby constituted shall become
enforceable and, in addition to all other rights and remedies available to
Lender as provided hereafter, Lender may, at its election, without notice of its
election and without demand, do any one or more of the following, all of which
are authorized by the Debtor:

                         (a) Proceed directly and at once, without notice,
against the Debtor to collect and recover the full amount or any portion of the
Secured Obligations, without first proceeding against any other Borrower, or
against any security or collateral for the Secured Obligations;

                         (b) Without notice to the Debtor and regardless of the
acceptance of any security or collateral for the payment hereof, appropriate and
apply toward the payment of the Secured Obligations (i) any indebtedness due or
to become due from Lender to the Debtor and (ii) any moneys, credits or other
property belonging to the Debtor at any time held by or coming into the
possession of Lender;

                         (c) Exercise in respect of the Collateral, in addition
to other rights and remedies provided for herein or otherwise available to it,
all the rights and remedies available to it at law (including those of a secured
party under the Code) or in equity;

                                      -6-
<PAGE>

                         (d) Settle or adjust disputes and claims directly with
Account Debtors for amounts and upon terms which Lender considers advisable, and
in such cases, Lender will credit the Loan Account with only the net amounts
received by Lender in payment of such disputed Accounts after deducting all
Lender Expenses incurred or expended in connection therewith;

                         (e) Without notice or demand upon the Debtor, make such
payments and do such acts as Lender considers necessary or reasonable to protect
its security interest in the Collateral. The Debtor agrees to make the
Collateral available to Lender as Lender may designate. The Debtor authorizes
Lender to enter the premises where the Collateral is located, to take and
maintain possession of the Collateral, or any part of it, and to pay, purchase,
contest, or compromise any encumbrance, charge, or lien which in Lender's
determination appears to be prior or superior to its security interest and to
pay all expenses incurred in connection therewith. With respect to any of the
Debtor' owned premises, the Debtor hereby grants Lender a license to enter into
possession of such premises and to occupy the same, without charge, in order to
exercise any of Lender's rights or remedies provided herein, at law, in equity,
or otherwise;

                         (f) Ship, reclaim, recover, store, finish, maintain,
repair, prepare for sale, advertise for sale, and sell (in the manner provided
for herein) the Collateral. Lender is hereby granted a license or other right to
use, without charge, the Debtor's labels, patents, copyrights, rights of use of
any name, trade secrets, trade names, trademarks, service marks, and advertising
matter, or any property of a similar nature, as it pertains to the Collateral,
in completing production of advertising for sale and selling any Collateral, and
the Debtor's rights under all licenses and all franchise agreements shall inure
to Lender's benefit;

                         (g) Sell all or any part of the Collateral at either a
public or private sale, or both, by way of one or more contracts or
transactions, for cash or on terms, in such manner and at such places (including
the Debtor's premises) as Lender determines is commercially reasonable. It is
not necessary that the Collateral be present at any such sale;

                         (h) Lender shall give notice of the disposition of the
Collateral as follows:

                             (i) Lender shall give the Debtor a notice in
writing of the time and place of public sale, or, if the sale is a private sale
or some other disposition other than a public sale is to be made of the
Collateral, then the time on or after which the private sale or other
disposition is to be made; and

                             (ii) The notice shall be personally delivered or
mailed, postage prepaid, to the Debtor as provided in Section 6, at least ten
(10) days before the earliest time of disposition set forth in the notice; no
notice needs to be given prior to the disposition of any portion of the
Collateral that is perishable or threatens to decline speedily in value or that
is of a type customarily sold on a recognized market;

                                      -7-

                         (i) Lender may credit bid and purchase at any public
sale;

                         (j) Lender may seek the appointment of a receiver or
keeper to take possession of all or any portion of the Collateral or to operate
same and, to the maximum extent permitted by law, may seek the appointment of
such a receiver or keeper without the requirement of prior notice or a hearing;

                         (k) Lender, on behalf of the Lender and the Bank
Product Providers, shall have all other rights and remedies available at law or
in equity or pursuant to any other Loan Document; and

                         (l) Any deficiency that exists after disposition of the
Collateral as provided above will be paid immediately by the Debtor. Any excess
will be returned, without interest and subject to the rights of third Persons,
by Lender to the Debtor.

                     3.2 REMEDIES CUMULATIVE. Lender's and the Bank Product
Providers' rights and remedies under this Agreement, the other Loan Documents,
and all other agreements shall be cumulative. The Lender and the Bank Product
Providers shall have all other rights and remedies not inconsistent herewith as
provided under the Code, by law, or in equity. No exercise by Lender of one
right or remedy shall be deemed an election, and no waiver by the Lender or the
Bank Product Providers of any Event of Default on the Debtor's part shall be
deemed a continuing waiver. No delay by the Lender or the Bank Product Providers
shall constitute a waiver, election, or acquiescence by it.

         4. INTENTIONALLY OMITTED.

         5. WAIVERS; INDEMNIFICATION.

                     5.1 DEMAND; PROTEST; ETC. Except as otherwise specifically

                     5.2 LIABILITY FOR COLLATERAL. So long as the Lender and the
Bank Product Providers comply with their obligations under the Code and no
willful misconduct or gross negligence occurs, Lender shall not in any way or
manner be liable or responsible for: (a) the safekeeping of the Collateral; (b)
any loss or damage thereto occurring or arising in any manner or fashion from
any cause; (c) any diminution in the value thereof; or (d) any act or default of
any carrier, warehouseman, bailee, forwarding agency, or other Person. All risk
of loss, damage, or destruction of the Collateral shall be borne by the Debtor.

                     5.3 INDEMNIFICATION. The Debtor agrees to defend,
indemnify, save, and hold the Lender-Related Persons, each Participant, and each
of their respective officers, employees, and agents (each an "Indemnified

disbursements) in any way suffered, incurred, or paid by the Lender or the Bank
Product Providers as a result of or in any way arising out of this Agreement,

have any obligation under this Section 5.3 with respect to any Indemnified
Liability that a court of competent jurisdiction finally determines to have
resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnified
Person. This provision shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

                6. NOTICES. All notices and other communications hereunder to
Lender shall be in writing and shall be mailed, sent or delivered in accordance
with the Credit Agreement and all notices and other communications hereunder to

Administrative Borrower in accordance with the Credit Agreement.

                7. CHOICE OF LAW AND VENUE; JURY TRIAL WAIVER. DEBTOR AND LENDER
AGREE THAT THE PROVISIONS IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH RESPECT TO CHOICE OF LAW
AND VENUE AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER ARE APPLICABLE TO THIS AGREEMENT AS IF FULLY SET
FORTH HEREIN.

deemed effective when executed by the Debtor and accepted and executed by
Lender.

                     8.2 SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. This Agreement shall bind and
inure to the benefit of the respective successors and assigns of each of the
parties; provided, however, that the Debtor may not assign this Agreement or any
rights or duties hereunder without Lender's prior written consent and any
prohibited assignment shall be absolutely void. No consent to an assignment by
Lender shall release the Debtor from its Secured Obligations. Subject to the
terms contained in Section 13 of the Credit Agreement, Lender may assign this

may be executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties on
separate counterparts, each of which, when executed and delivered, shall be
deemed to be an original, and all of which, when taken together, shall
constitute but one and the same Agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart
of this Agreement by telefacsimile shall be equally as effective as delivery of
an original executed counterpart of this Agreement. Any party delivering an
executed counterpart of this Agreement by telefacsimile also shall deliver an
original executed counterpart of this Agreement but the failure to deliver an
original executed counterpart shall not affect the validity, enforceability, and
binding effect of this Agreement.

                     8.8 REVIVAL AND REINSTATEMENT OF OBLIGATIONS. If the
incurrence or payment of the Secured Obligations by the Debtor or the transfer
by the Debtor to Lender of any property of the Debtor should for any reason
subsequently be declared to be void or voidable under any state or federal law
relating to creditors' rights, including provisions of the Bankruptcy Code
relating to fraudulent conveyances, preferences, and other voidable or
recoverable payments of money or transfers of property (collectively, a
"Voidable Transfer"), and if Lender is required to repay or restore, in whole or
in part, any such Voidable Transfer, or elects to do so upon the reasonable
advice of its counsel, then, as to any such Voidable Transfer, or the amount
thereof that Lender is required or elects to repay or restore, and as to all
reasonable costs, expenses, and attorneys' fees of Lender related thereto, the
liability of the Debtor automatically shall be revived, reinstated, and restored
and shall exist as though such Voidable Transfer had never been made.

                  This SECURITY AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") dated as of
December 9, 2004, is made by SWIFT TELECOMMUNICATIONS, INC., a Delaware
corporation (the "Debtor"), in favor of WELLS FARGO FOOTHILL, INC., a California
corporation (together with its successors and assigns, the "Lender").

                                R E C I T A L S:

                  WHEREAS, the Debtor and certain of its Affiliates
(individually a "Borrower" and collectively, "Borrowers"), are parties with the
Lender to that certain Credit Agreement of even date herewith (as the same may
be amended, restated, supplemented or modified from time to time, the "Credit
Agreement"), which provides for, among other things, the ability of Borrowers to
obtain certain loans (the "Loans") from the Lender upon the terms and provisions
and subject to the conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement. Capitalized
terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms
in the Credit Agreement; and

                  WHEREAS, the Debtor desires to secure its obligations under
the Credit Agreement by granting to Lender, for the benefit of the Lender and

                  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises set forth
above, the terms and conditions contained herein and other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, and
each intending to be bound hereby, Lender and the Debtor agree as follows:

                  1. DEFINITIONS AND CONSTRUCTION.

                     1.1 DEFINITIONS. All capitalized terms used herein and not

Agreement. As used in this Agreement, the following terms shall have the

reference.

                  2. CREATION OF SECURITY INTEREST.

                     2.1 GRANT OF SECURITY INTEREST. The Debtor hereby grants to
Lender, for the benefit of the Lender and the Bank Product Providers, a security
interest in all of its right, title, and interest in all currently existing and
hereafter acquired or arising Collateral in order to secure prompt repayment of
any and all of the Secured Obligations in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the Loan Documents and in order to secure prompt performance by
the Debtor of the Debtor's covenants and duties under the Loan Documents.
Lender's Liens in and to the Collateral shall attach to all Collateral without
further act on the part of Lender or the Debtor. Anything contained in this
Agreement or any other Loan Document to the contrary notwithstanding, except for
Permitted Dispositions, the Debtor has no authority, express or implied, to
dispose of any item or portion of the Collateral.

                     2.2 NEGOTIABLE COLLATERAL. In the event that any
Collateral, including proceeds, is evidenced by or consists of Negotiable
Collateral, and if and to the extent that perfection or priority of Lender's
security interest is dependent on or enhanced by possession, the Debtor,
promptly upon the request of Lender, shall endorse and assign such Negotiable
Collateral to Lender and deliver physical possession of such Negotiable
Collateral to Lender.

                     2.3 COLLECTION OF ACCOUNTS, GENERAL INTANGIBLES, NEGOTIABLE
COLLATERAL. At any time after the occurrence and during the continuation of an
Event of Default, Lender or its designee may (a) notify Account Debtors of the
Debtor that the Accounts, chattel paper, or General Intangibles have been
assigned to Lender or that Lender has a security interest therein, or (b)
collect the Accounts, chattel paper, or General Intangibles directly and charge
the reasonable collection costs and expenses to the Loan Account.

                     2.4 DELIVERY OF ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED.

                         (a) The Debtor authorizes Lender to file any financing
statement necessary or desirable to effectuate the transactions contemplated by
the Loan Documents, and any continuation statement or amendment with respect
thereto, in any appropriate filing office without the signature of the Debtor
where permitted by applicable law and describing the Collateral in the same
manner as described herein.

                         (b) At any time upon the request of Lender, the Debtor
shall execute and deliver to Lender, any and all financing statements, original
financing statements in lieu of continuation statements, fixture filings,
security agreements, pledges, assignments, endorsements of certificates of
title, and all other documents (the "Additional Documents") that Lender may
request in its Permitted Discretion, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Lender, to perfect and continue perfection or better perfect the
Lender's Liens in the Collateral (whether now owned or hereafter arising or
acquired), and in order to fully consummate all of the transactions contemplated
hereby and under the other Loan Documents. If Debtor or its Subsidiaries acquire
any material commercial tort claims after the date hereof, Debtor shall promptly
(but in any event within 3 Business Days after such acquisition) deliver to
Secured Party a written description of such material commercial tort claim and
shall deliver a written agreement, in form and substance satisfactory to Secured
Party, pursuant to which the Debtor or its Subsidiary shall pledge and
collaterally assign all of its right, title and interest in and to such material
commercial tort claim to Secured Party, as security for the Secured Obligations.

                     2.5 POWER OF ATTORNEY. The Debtor hereby irrevocably
appoints Lender (and any of Lender's officers, employees, or agents designated
by Lender) as the Debtor's attorney-in-fact, with power to: (a) if the Debtor
refuses to, or fails timely to execute and deliver any of the documents
described in Section 2.4, sign the name of the Debtor on any of the documents
described in Section 2.4; (b) at any time that an Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing, sign the Debtor's name on any invoice or bill of lading
relating to the Collateral, drafts against Account Debtors, or notices to
Account Debtors; (c) send requests for verification of Accounts; (d) endorse the
Debtor's name on any Collection item that may come into Lender's possession; (e)
at any time that an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, make,
settle, and adjust all claims under the Debtor's policies of insurance and make
all determinations and decisions with respect to such policies of insurance
(other than workers' compensation); and (f) at any time that an Event of Default
has occurred and is continuing, settle and adjust disputes and claims respecting
the Accounts, chattel paper, or General Intangibles directly with Account
Debtors, for amounts and upon terms which Lender determines to be reasonable,
and Lender may cause to be executed and delivered any documents and releases
which Lender determines to be necessary. The appointment of Lender as the
Debtor's attorney, and each and every one of Lender's rights and powers, being
coupled with an interest, is irrevocable until, and shall terminate when, all of
the Secured Obligations have been fully and finally repaid and performed and
Lender's obligation to extend credit under the Credit Agreement is terminated.

                     2.6 INTENTIONALLY OMITTED.

                     2.7 CONTROL AGREEMENT. The Debtor agrees that it will not
transfer assets out of any Securities Account or Deposit Account other than as
permitted under the Credit Agreement. No arrangement contemplated hereby or by
any Control Agreement in respect of any Securities Account, Deposit Account, or
other Investment Property shall be modified by the Debtor without the prior
written consent of Lender. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an
Event of Default, Lender may notify any bank or securities intermediary to
liquidate the applicable Deposit Account or Securities Account or any related
Investment Property maintained or held thereby and remit the proceeds thereof to
the Lender's Account.

                     2.8 RELEASE OF SECURITY INTEREST. Upon the payment in full
of all Secured Obligations or the cancellation or termination of the commitments
and any other contingent obligation included in the Secured Obligations, the
security interest granted hereby shall terminate hereunder and all rights to the
Collateral shall revert and be deemed reassigned to the Debtor. Upon any such
termination, the Lender shall, at the Debtor's request and expense, execute and
deliver to the Debtor such documents as the Debtor shall reasonably request to
evidence such termination and/or reassignment, without recourse, representation
or warranty of any kind.

                  3. LENDER'S RIGHTS AND REMEDIES.

                     3.1 RIGHTS AND REMEDIES. Upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default, the security hereby constituted shall become
enforceable and, in addition to all other rights and remedies available to
Lender as provided hereafter, Lender may, at its election, without notice of its
election and without demand, do any one or more of the following, all of which
are authorized by the Debtor:

                         (a) Proceed directly and at once, without notice,
against the Debtor to collect and recover the full amount or any portion of the

against any security or collateral for the Secured Obligations;

                         (b) Without notice to the Debtor and regardless of the
acceptance of any security or collateral for the payment hereof, appropriate and
apply toward the payment of the Secured Obligations (i) any indebtedness due or
to become due from Lender to the Debtor and (ii) any moneys, credits or other
property belonging to the Debtor at any time held by or coming into the

<PAGE>

                         (d) Settle or adjust disputes and claims directly with

Lender Expenses incurred or expended in connection therewith;

                         (e) Without notice or demand upon the Debtor, make such
payments and do such acts as Lender considers necessary or reasonable to protect
its security interest in the Collateral. The Debtor agrees to make the
Collateral available to Lender as Lender may designate. The Debtor authorizes
Lender to enter the premises where the Collateral is located, to take and
maintain possession of the Collateral, or any part of it, and to pay, purchase,
contest, or compromise any encumbrance, charge, or lien which in Lender's
determination appears to be prior or superior to its security interest and to
pay all expenses incurred in connection therewith. With respect to any of the
Debtor' owned premises, the Debtor hereby grants Lender a license to enter into
possession of such premises and to occupy the same, without charge, in order to
exercise any of Lender's rights or remedies provided herein, at law, in equity,
or otherwise;

                         (f) Ship, reclaim, recover, store, finish, maintain,

any name, trade secrets, trade names, trademarks, service marks, and advertising
matter, or any property of a similar nature, as it pertains to the Collateral,
in completing production of advertising for sale and selling any Collateral, and
the Debtor's rights under all licenses and all franchise agreements shall inure
to Lender's benefit;

                         (g) Sell all or any part of the Collateral at either a
public or private sale, or both, by way of one or more contracts or
transactions, for cash or on terms, in such manner and at such places (including
the Debtor's premises) as Lender determines is commercially reasonable. It is
not necessary that the Collateral be present at any such sale;

                         (h) Lender shall give notice of the disposition of the
Collateral as follows:

                             (i) Lender shall give the Debtor a notice in
writing of the time and place of public sale, or, if the sale is a private sale
or some other disposition other than a public sale is to be made of the
Collateral, then the time on or after which the private sale or other
disposition is to be made; and

                             (ii) The notice shall be personally delivered or
mailed, postage prepaid, to the Debtor as provided in Section 6, at least ten
(10) days before the earliest time of disposition set forth in the notice; no
notice needs to be given prior to the disposition of any portion of the
Collateral that is perishable or threatens to decline speedily in value or that
is of a type customarily sold on a recognized market;

sale;

                         (j) Lender may seek the appointment of a receiver or

same and, to the maximum extent permitted by law, may seek the appointment of
such a receiver or keeper without the requirement of prior notice or a hearing;

                         (k) Lender, on behalf of the Lender and the Bank
Product Providers, shall have all other rights and remedies available at law or
in equity or pursuant to any other Loan Document; and

                         (l) Any deficiency that exists after disposition of the
Collateral as provided above will be paid immediately by the Debtor. Any excess
will be returned, without interest and subject to the rights of third Persons,
by Lender to the Debtor.

                     3.2 REMEDIES CUMULATIVE. Lender's and the Bank Product
Providers' rights and remedies under this Agreement, the other Loan Documents,
and all other agreements shall be cumulative. The Lender and the Bank Product
Providers shall have all other rights and remedies not inconsistent herewith as
provided under the Code, by law, or in equity. No exercise by Lender of one
right or remedy shall be deemed an election, and no waiver by the Lender or the
Bank Product Providers of any Event of Default on the Debtor's part shall be
deemed a continuing waiver. No delay by the Lender or the Bank Product Providers
shall constitute a waiver, election, or acquiescence by it.

                     5.2 LIABILITY FOR COLLATERAL. So long as the Lender and the
Bank Product Providers comply with their obligations under the Code and no
willful misconduct or gross negligence occurs, Lender shall not in any way or
manner be liable or responsible for: (a) the safekeeping of the Collateral; (b)
any loss or damage thereto occurring or arising in any manner or fashion from
any cause; (c) any diminution in the value thereof; or (d) any act or default of
any carrier, warehouseman, bailee, forwarding agency, or other Person. All risk
of loss, damage, or destruction of the Collateral shall be borne by the Debtor.

Lender.

                     8.2 SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. This Agreement shall bind and
inure to the benefit of the respective successors and assigns of each of the
parties; provided, however, that the Debtor may not assign this Agreement or any
rights or duties hereunder without Lender's prior written consent and any
prohibited assignment shall be absolutely void. No consent to an assignment by
Lender shall release the Debtor from its Secured Obligations. Subject to the

uncertainty or ambiguity herein shall be construed or interpreted against the

meaning of the words used so as to fairly accomplish the purposes and intentions
of all parties hereto.

                     8.5 SEVERABILITY OF PROVISIONS. Each provision of this

                     8.7 COUNTERPARTS; TELEFACSIMILE EXECUTION. This Agreement
may be executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties on
separate counterparts, each of which, when executed and delivered, shall be
deemed to be an original, and all of which, when taken together, shall
constitute but one and the same Agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart
of this Agreement by telefacsimile shall be equally as effective as delivery of
an original executed counterpart of this Agreement. Any party delivering an
executed counterpart of this Agreement by telefacsimile also shall deliver an
original executed counterpart of this Agreement but the failure to deliver an
original executed counterpart shall not affect the validity, enforceability, and
binding effect of this Agreement.

                     8.8 REVIVAL AND REINSTATEMENT OF OBLIGATIONS. If the
incurrence or payment of the Secured Obligations by the Debtor or the transfer
by the Debtor to Lender of any property of the Debtor should for any reason
subsequently be declared to be void or voidable under any state or federal law
relating to creditors' rights, including provisions of the Bankruptcy Code
relating to fraudulent conveyances, preferences, and other voidable or
recoverable payments of money or transfers of property (collectively, a
"Voidable Transfer"), and if Lender is required to repay or restore, in whole or
in part, any such Voidable Transfer, or elects to do so upon the reasonable
advice of its counsel, then, as to any such Voidable Transfer, or the amount
thereof that Lender is required or elects to repay or restore, and as to all
reasonable costs, expenses, and attorneys' fees of Lender related thereto, the
liability of the Debtor automatically shall be revived, reinstated, and restored
and shall exist as though such Voidable Transfer had never been made.

                     1.4 SCHEDULES AND EXHIBITS. All of the schedules and
exhibits attached to this Agreement shall be deemed incorporated herein by
reference.

                  2. CREATION OF SECURITY INTEREST.

                     2.1 GRANT OF SECURITY INTEREST. The Debtor hereby grants to
Lender, for the benefit of the Lender and the Bank Product Providers, a security
interest in all of its right, title, and interest in all currently existing and
hereafter acquired or arising Collateral in order to secure prompt repayment of
any and all of the Secured Obligations in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the Loan Documents and in order to secure prompt performance by
the Debtor of the Debtor's covenants and duties under the Loan Documents.
Lender's Liens in and to the Collateral shall attach to all Collateral without
further act on the part of Lender or the Debtor. Anything contained in this
Agreement or any other Loan Document to the contrary notwithstanding, except for
Permitted Dispositions, the Debtor has no authority, express or implied, to
dispose of any item or portion of the Collateral.

                     2.2 NEGOTIABLE COLLATERAL. In the event that any
Collateral, including proceeds, is evidenced by or consists of Negotiable
Collateral, and if and to the extent that perfection or priority of Lender's
security interest is dependent on or enhanced by possession, the Debtor,
promptly upon the request of Lender, shall endorse and assign such Negotiable
Collateral to Lender and deliver physical possession of such Negotiable
Collateral to Lender.

                     2.3 COLLECTION OF ACCOUNTS, GENERAL INTANGIBLES, NEGOTIABLE
COLLATERAL. At any time after the occurrence and during the continuation of an
Event of Default, Lender or its designee may (a) notify Account Debtors of the
Debtor that the Accounts, chattel paper, or General Intangibles have been
assigned to Lender or that Lender has a security interest therein, or (b)
collect the Accounts, chattel paper, or General Intangibles directly and charge
the reasonable collection costs and expenses to the Loan Account.

                     2.4 DELIVERY OF ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED.

                         (a) The Debtor authorizes Lender to file any financing
statement necessary or desirable to effectuate the transactions contemplated by
the Loan Documents, and any continuation statement or amendment with respect
thereto, in any appropriate filing office without the signature of the Debtor
where permitted by applicable law and describing the Collateral in the same
manner as described herein.

                         (b) At any time upon the request of Lender, the Debtor
shall execute and deliver to Lender, any and all financing statements, original
financing statements in lieu of continuation statements, fixture filings,
security agreements, pledges, assignments, endorsements of certificates of
title, and all other documents (the "Additional Documents") that Lender may
request in its Permitted Discretion, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Lender, to perfect and continue perfection or better perfect the
Lender's Liens in the Collateral (whether now owned or hereafter arising or
acquired), and in order to fully consummate all of the transactions contemplated
hereby and under the other Loan Documents. If Debtor or its Subsidiaries acquire
any material commercial tort claims after the date hereof, Debtor shall promptly
(but in any event within 3 Business Days after such acquisition) deliver to
Secured Party a written description of such material commercial tort claim and
shall deliver a written agreement, in form and substance satisfactory to Secured
Party, pursuant to which the Debtor or its Subsidiary shall pledge and
collaterally assign all of its right, title and interest in and to such material
commercial tort claim to Secured Party, as security for the Secured Obligations.

                     2.5 POWER OF ATTORNEY. The Debtor hereby irrevocably
appoints Lender (and any of Lender's officers, employees, or agents designated
by Lender) as the Debtor's attorney-in-fact, with power to: (a) if the Debtor
refuses to, or fails timely to execute and deliver any of the documents
described in Section 2.4, sign the name of the Debtor on any of the documents
described in Section 2.4; (b) at any time that an Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing, sign the Debtor's name on any invoice or bill of lading
relating to the Collateral, drafts against Account Debtors, or notices to
Account Debtors; (c) send requests for verification of Accounts; (d) endorse the
Debtor's name on any Collection item that may come into Lender's possession; (e)
at any time that an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, make,
settle, and adjust all claims under the Debtor's policies of insurance and make
all determinations and decisions with respect to such policies of insurance
(other than workers' compensation); and (f) at any time that an Event of Default
has occurred and is continuing, settle and adjust disputes and claims respecting
the Accounts, chattel paper, or General Intangibles directly with Account
Debtors, for amounts and upon terms which Lender determines to be reasonable,
and Lender may cause to be executed and delivered any documents and releases
which Lender determines to be necessary. The appointment of Lender as the
Debtor's attorney, and each and every one of Lender's rights and powers, being
coupled with an interest, is irrevocable until, and shall terminate when, all of
the Secured Obligations have been fully and finally repaid and performed and
Lender's obligation to extend credit under the Credit Agreement is terminated.

                     2.7 CONTROL AGREEMENT. The Debtor agrees that it will not
transfer assets out of any Securities Account or Deposit Account other than as
permitted under the Credit Agreement. No arrangement contemplated hereby or by
any Control Agreement in respect of any Securities Account, Deposit Account, or
other Investment Property shall be modified by the Debtor without the prior
written consent of Lender. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an
Event of Default, Lender may notify any bank or securities intermediary to
liquidate the applicable Deposit Account or Securities Account or any related
Investment Property maintained or held thereby and remit the proceeds thereof to
the Lender's Account.

                     2.8 RELEASE OF SECURITY INTEREST. Upon the payment in full
of all Secured Obligations or the cancellation or termination of the commitments
and any other contingent obligation included in the Secured Obligations, the
security interest granted hereby shall terminate hereunder and all rights to the
Collateral shall revert and be deemed reassigned to the Debtor. Upon any such
termination, the Lender shall, at the Debtor's request and expense, execute and
deliver to the Debtor such documents as the Debtor shall reasonably request to
evidence such termination and/or reassignment, without recourse, representation
or warranty of any kind.

                  3. LENDER'S RIGHTS AND REMEDIES.

                     3.1 RIGHTS AND REMEDIES. Upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default, the security hereby constituted shall become
enforceable and, in addition to all other rights and remedies available to
Lender as provided hereafter, Lender may, at its election, without notice of its
election and without demand, do any one or more of the following, all of which
are authorized by the Debtor:

                         (a) Proceed directly and at once, without notice,
against the Debtor to collect and recover the full amount or any portion of the
Secured Obligations, without first proceeding against any other Borrower, or
against any security or collateral for the Secured Obligations;

                         (b) Without notice to the Debtor and regardless of the
acceptance of any security or collateral for the payment hereof, appropriate and
apply toward the payment of the Secured Obligations (i) any indebtedness due or
to become due from Lender to the Debtor and (ii) any moneys, credits or other
property belonging to the Debtor at any time held by or coming into the
possession of Lender;

                         (c) Exercise in respect of the Collateral, in addition
to other rights and remedies provided for herein or otherwise available to it,

<PAGE>

                         (d) Settle or adjust disputes and claims directly with
Account Debtors for amounts and upon terms which Lender considers advisable, and
in such cases, Lender will credit the Loan Account with only the net amounts
received by Lender in payment of such disputed Accounts after deducting all
Lender Expenses incurred or expended in connection therewith;

                         (e) Without notice or demand upon the Debtor, make such
payments and do such acts as Lender considers necessary or reasonable to protect
its security interest in the Collateral. The Debtor agrees to make the
Collateral available to Lender as Lender may designate. The Debtor authorizes
Lender to enter the premises where the Collateral is located, to take and
maintain possession of the Collateral, or any part of it, and to pay, purchase,
contest, or compromise any encumbrance, charge, or lien which in Lender's
determination appears to be prior or superior to its security interest and to
pay all expenses incurred in connection therewith. With respect to any of the
Debtor' owned premises, the Debtor hereby grants Lender a license to enter into
possession of such premises and to occupy the same, without charge, in order to
exercise any of Lender's rights or remedies provided herein, at law, in equity,
or otherwise;

                         (f) Ship, reclaim, recover, store, finish, maintain,
repair, prepare for sale, advertise for sale, and sell (in the manner provided
for herein) the Collateral. Lender is hereby granted a license or other right to
use, without charge, the Debtor's labels, patents, copyrights, rights of use of
any name, trade secrets, trade names, trademarks, service marks, and advertising
matter, or any property of a similar nature, as it pertains to the Collateral,
in completing production of advertising for sale and selling any Collateral, and
the Debtor's rights under all licenses and all franchise agreements shall inure
to Lender's benefit;

                         (g) Sell all or any part of the Collateral at either a
public or private sale, or both, by way of one or more contracts or
transactions, for cash or on terms, in such manner and at such places (including
the Debtor's premises) as Lender determines is commercially reasonable. It is
not necessary that the Collateral be present at any such sale;

                         (h) Lender shall give notice of the disposition of the
Collateral as follows:

                             (i) Lender shall give the Debtor a notice in
writing of the time and place of public sale, or, if the sale is a private sale
or some other disposition other than a public sale is to be made of the
Collateral, then the time on or after which the private sale or other
disposition is to be made; and

                             (ii) The notice shall be personally delivered or
mailed, postage prepaid, to the Debtor as provided in Section 6, at least ten
(10) days before the earliest time of disposition set forth in the notice; no
notice needs to be given prior to the disposition of any portion of the
Collateral that is perishable or threatens to decline speedily in value or that
is of a type customarily sold on a recognized market;

<PAGE>

                         (i) Lender may credit bid and purchase at any public
sale;

                         (j) Lender may seek the appointment of a receiver or
keeper to take possession of all or any portion of the Collateral or to operate
same and, to the maximum extent permitted by law, may seek the appointment of
such a receiver or keeper without the requirement of prior notice or a hearing;

                         (k) Lender, on behalf of the Lender and the Bank
Product Providers, shall have all other rights and remedies available at law or
in equity or pursuant to any other Loan Document; and

                         (l) Any deficiency that exists after disposition of the
Collateral as provided above will be paid immediately by the Debtor. Any excess
will be returned, without interest and subject to the rights of third Persons,
by Lender to the Debtor.

                     3.2 REMEDIES CUMULATIVE. Lender's and the Bank Product
Providers' rights and remedies under this Agreement, the other Loan Documents,
and all other agreements shall be cumulative. The Lender and the Bank Product
Providers shall have all other rights and remedies not inconsistent herewith as
provided under the Code, by law, or in equity. No exercise by Lender of one
right or remedy shall be deemed an election, and no waiver by the Lender or the
Bank Product Providers of any Event of Default on the Debtor's part shall be
deemed a continuing waiver. No delay by the Lender or the Bank Product Providers
shall constitute a waiver, election, or acquiescence by it.

                  4. INTENTIONALLY OMITTED.

                  5. WAIVERS; INDEMNIFICATION.

                     5.2 LIABILITY FOR COLLATERAL. So long as the Lender and the
Bank Product Providers comply with their obligations under the Code and no
willful misconduct or gross negligence occurs, Lender shall not in any way or
manner be liable or responsible for: (a) the safekeeping of the Collateral; (b)
any loss or damage thereto occurring or arising in any manner or fashion from
any cause; (c) any diminution in the value thereof; or (d) any act or default of
any carrier, warehouseman, bailee, forwarding agency, or other Person. All risk
of loss, damage, or destruction of the Collateral shall be borne by the Debtor.

disbursements) in any way suffered, incurred, or paid by the Lender or the Bank
Product Providers as a result of or in any way arising out of this Agreement,

                     8.4 INTERPRETATION. Neither this Agreement nor any
uncertainty or ambiguity herein shall be construed or interpreted against the
Lender, the Bank Product Providers or the Debtor, whether under any rule of
construction or otherwise. On the contrary, this Agreement has been reviewed by
all parties and shall be construed and interpreted according to the ordinary
meaning of the words used so as to fairly accomplish the purposes and intentions
of all parties hereto.

                     8.5 SEVERABILITY OF PROVISIONS. Each provision of this
Agreement shall be severable from every other provision of this Agreement for
the purpose of determining the legal enforceability of any specific provision.

                     8.6 AMENDMENTS IN WRITING. This Agreement can only be
amended by a writing signed by Lender and the Debtor.

                     8.7 COUNTERPARTS; TELEFACSIMILE EXECUTION. This Agreement
may be executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties on
separate counterparts, each of which, when executed and delivered, shall be
deemed to be an original, and all of which, when taken together, shall
constitute but one and the same Agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart
of this Agreement by telefacsimile shall be equally as effective as delivery of
an original executed counterpart of this Agreement. Any party delivering an
executed counterpart of this Agreement by telefacsimile also shall deliver an
original executed counterpart of this Agreement but the failure to deliver an
original executed counterpart shall not affect the validity, enforceability, and
binding effect of this Agreement.

                     8.8 REVIVAL AND REINSTATEMENT OF OBLIGATIONS. If the
incurrence or payment of the Secured Obligations by the Debtor or the transfer
by the Debtor to Lender of any property of the Debtor should for any reason
subsequently be declared to be void or voidable under any state or federal law
relating to creditors' rights, including provisions of the Bankruptcy Code
relating to fraudulent conveyances, preferences, and other voidable or
recoverable payments of money or transfers of property (collectively, a
"Voidable Transfer"), and if Lender is required to repay or restore, in whole or
in part, any such Voidable Transfer, or elects to do so upon the reasonable
advice of its counsel, then, as to any such Voidable Transfer, or the amount
thereof that Lender is required or elects to repay or restore, and as to all
reasonable costs, expenses, and attorneys' fees of Lender related thereto, the
liability of the Debtor automatically shall be revived, reinstated, and restored
and shall exist as though such Voidable Transfer had never been made.

EXHIBIT 10.6



                                PLEDGE AGREEMENT



         THIS PLEDGE AGREEMENT (this "Agreement"), dated as of December 9, 2004,
is made by EASYLINK SERVICES CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation ("Pledgor"), in
favor of WELLS FARGO FOOTHILL, INC., a California corporation (together with its
successors and assigns, the "Pledgee").

                                    RECITALS:

         A. Pledgor is the shareholder of the entities listed on Annex A
attached hereto and made a part hereof (collectively, the "Issuers").

         B. Pledgor and certain of its Subsidiaries (each a "Borrower" and
collectively, the "Borrowers") is a party with the Pledgee, to that certain
Credit Agreement of even date herewith (as the same may be amended, supplemented
or modified from time to time, the "Credit Agreement"), pursuant to which the
Pledgor has requested that the Pledgee make certain loans to the Pledgor;
capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed
thereto in the Credit Agreement.

         C. It is a condition precedent to the making of the loans under and
pursuant to the Credit Agreement that the Pledgor execute and deliver this
Agreement and shall have made the pledge contemplated hereunder in favor of the
Pledgee for the benefit of the Pledgee and the Bank Product Providers.

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises hereinabove, and to
induce the Pledgee to make the loans identified hereinabove pursuant to the
Credit Agreement and in consideration of the benefits accruing to the Pledgor,
and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt, adequacy and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Pledgor hereby covenants and
agrees with the Pledgee for the benefit of the Pledgee and the Bank Product
Providers as follows:

         1. INCORPORATION OF CREDIT AGREEMENT; SECURITY FOR OBLIGATIONS. The
Credit Agreement and the terms and provisions thereof are hereby incorporated
herein in their entirety by this reference thereto. All terms capitalized but
not otherwise defined herein shall have the same meanings herein as in the
Credit Agreement. This Agreement is for the benefit of the Pledgee and the Bank
Product Providers to secure the prompt and complete payment and performance when
due of all indebtedness, liabilities, obligations (including the Obligations),
or undertakings owing by the Borrowers to the Pledgee or any Bank Product
Provider, of any kind or description arising out of or outstanding under,
advanced or issued pursuant to, or evidenced by the Credit Agreement, this
Agreement, or any of the other Loan Documents, irrespective of whether for the
payment of money, whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, due or to
become due, voluntary or involuntary, whether now existing or hereafter arising,
and including all interest, costs, indemnities, fees (including attorneys' fees)
and expenses (including interest, costs, indemnities, fees and expenses that,
but for the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, would have accrued irrespective
of whether a claim therefore is allowed) and any and all other amounts which any
Borrower is required to pay pursuant to any of the foregoing, by law, or
otherwise owing by a Borrower to the Pledgee and/or the Bank Product Providers,
including, without limitation, the "Obligations," as defined in the Credit
Agreement (collectively, the "Obligations") (all of the foregoing being herein
collectively called the "Secured Obligations").


<PAGE>

         2. DEFINITION OF PLEDGED COLLATERAL. As used herein, the term "Pledged
Collateral" shall mean the securities and investment property described on Annex
A attached hereto and made a part hereof, and any additional Pledged Collateral
acquired pursuant to Section 3.2 below which Annex A may be supplemented from
time to time pursuant to Section 3.2 below. The Pledgor represents and warrants
to the Pledgee for the benefit of the Pledgee and the Bank Product Providers
that on the date hereof (a) Annex A attached hereto correctly identifies the
Pledged Collateral owned by Pledgor with respect to each of the Issuers; and (b)
the Pledgor is the holder of record and sole beneficial and legal owner of such
Pledged Collateral.

         3. PLEDGE OF PLEDGED COLLATERAL AND OTHER COLLATERAL.

         3.1 Pledge. To secure the Secured Obligations and for the purposes set
forth in Section 1 hereof, Pledgor hereby pledges, collaterally assigns and
conveys, and grants a security interest in and lien on, in favor of Pledgee for
the benefit of the Pledgee and the Bank Product Providers, all of Pledgor's
right, title and interest in, to, and under (A) the Pledged Collateral, (B) any
additional Pledged Collateral acquired pursuant to Section 3.2 below (whether by
purchase, dividend, merger, consolidation, sale of assets, split, spin-off, or
any other dividend or distribution of any kind or otherwise), (C) all
distributions, dividends, cash, certificates, liquidation rights and interests,
options, rights, warrants, instruments or other property from time to time
received, receivable or otherwise distributed in respect of or in exchange or
substitution for any and all of the Pledged Collateral, (D) the Pledgor's right
to vote the Pledged Collateral, and (E) all proceeds, products, replacements and
substitutions for any of the foregoing, in each case whether now owned or
hereafter acquired by the Pledgor (collectively, the "Collateral"). If the
Pledged Collateral is evidenced by certificates, then the Pledgor shall
concurrently herewith deposit with the Pledgee, the Pledged Collateral owned by
the Pledgor on the date hereof and the certificates representing the Pledge
Collateral accompanied by "stock powers" or an Assignment Separate From
Certificate duly executed in blank by the Pledgor. Whether or not the Pledged
Collateral is evidenced by certificates, the Pledgor hereby permits the Pledgee
to file a UCC Financing Statement naming the Pledgor as debtor and the Pledgee
as secured party with respect to the Pledged Collateral with the Delaware
Secretary of State, in form and substance satisfactory to the Pledgee in its
sole and absolute determination, and without the requirement of the Pledgor's
signature. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
the Pledgee shall not as a result of this Agreement be responsible or liable for
any obligations or liabilities of the Pledgor in the Pledgor's capacity as a
shareholder, if any, and the Pledgee shall not be deemed to have assumed any of
such obligations or liabilities.


                                       -2-
<PAGE>


         3.2 Subsequently Acquired Pledged Collateral. If at any time or from
time to time after the date hereof during the term of this Agreement, the
Pledgor shall acquire any additional Pledged Collateral, including any further
stock or equity in each of the Issuers (whether by purchase, dividend, merger,
consolidation, sale of assets, split, spin-off, or any other dividend or
distribution of any kind or otherwise), then the Pledgor will forthwith pledge
and, if applicable, deposit such additional Pledged Collateral with the Pledgee
and deliver to the Pledgee certificates or instruments therefor, endorsed in
blank by the Pledgor or accompanied by "stock powers" or an Assignment Separate
From Certificate duly executed in blank by the Pledgor, and will promptly
thereafter deliver to the Pledgee a certificate (which shall be deemed to
supplement Annex A attached hereto) executed by the Pledgor describing such
Pledged Collateral and the other Pledged Collateral pledged to the Pledgee, and
certifying that the same have been duly pledged with the Pledgee hereunder.
Whether or not such additional Pledged Collateral is evidenced by certificates,
the Pledgor shall permit the Pledgee to file a UCC Financing Statement naming
the Pledgor as debtor and the Pledgee as secured party with respect to the
additional Collateral with the Delaware Secretary of State, in form and
substance satisfactory to the Pledgee in its sole and absolute determination,
and without the requirement of the Pledgor's signature.

         3.3 Uncertificated Pledged Collateral. In addition to anything
contained in Sections 3.1 and 3.2 hereof, if any Pledged Collateral (whether now
owned or hereafter acquired) is not certificated or becomes an uncertificated
security, the Pledgor shall promptly notify the Pledgee thereof and shall
promptly take all actions required to perfect the security interest and pledge
in favor of the Pledgee under applicable law (including, in any event, any
action required or appropriate under this Agreement or the Uniform Commercial
Code of the State of New York or equivalent provisions of any other applicable
jurisdiction (the "UCC")). The Pledgor further agrees to take such actions as
the Pledgee deems necessary or desirable to effectuate the foregoing and to
permit the Pledgee to exercise any of its rights and remedies hereunder.

         4. VOTING, ETC. Unless and until an Event of Default (as defined in the
Credit Agreement) occurs and is continuing, the Pledgor shall be entitled to
vote any and all of the Pledged Collateral; provided, however, that no vote
shall be cast or any action taken by Pledgor which would violate or be
inconsistent with any of the terms of this Agreement, the Credit Agreement, any
other Loan Document or any other instrument or agreement relating to the Secured
Obligations, or which would have the effect of impairing the position or
interests of the Pledgee or which would authorize or effect actions prohibited
under the terms of the Credit Agreement or any Loan Document. All such rights of
the Pledgor to vote shall cease upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, if
the Pledgee so directs and notifies the Pledgor.

         5. PAYMENTS AND OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS. Unless and until an Event of
Default (as defined in the Credit Agreement) shall occur and be continuing, all
cash dividends or distributions payable in respect of the Pledged Collateral (to
the extent such payments shall be permitted pursuant to the terms and provisions
of the Credit Agreement) shall be paid to the Pledgor; provided, however, upon
an Event of Default, all cash dividends or distributions payable in respect of
the Pledged Collateral shall be paid to the Pledgee as security for the Secured
Obligations; provided, further, that all cash dividends and distributions
payable at any time (whether before or after an Event of Default) in respect of
the Pledged Collateral which are determined by Pledgee, in its sole discretion,
to represent in whole or in part an extraordinary, liquidating or other
distribution in return of capital shall be promptly paid and delivered to the
Pledgee and retained by the Pledgee as part of the Collateral. The Pledgee shall
be entitled to receive directly, and to retain as part of the Collateral:



                                       -3-
<PAGE>

         (a) all other or additional securities or investment property, or
rights to subscribe for or purchase any of the foregoing, or property (other
than cash) paid or distributed by way of dividend in respect of the Pledged
Collateral;

         (b) all other or additional securities, investment property or property
(including cash) paid or distributed in respect of the Pledged Collateral by way
of split, spin-off, split-up, reclassification, combination of shares or similar
rearrangement; and

         (c) all other or additional securities, investment property or property
which may be paid in respect of the Collateral by reason of any consolidation,
merger, exchange, dividend, split, or distribution, conveyance of assets,
liquidation or similar reorganization or other disposition of Collateral (to the
extent any of the foregoing actions are permitted under the Credit Agreement).

         If at any time the Pledgor shall obtain or possess any of the foregoing
Collateral described in this Section, the Pledgor shall be deemed to hold such
Collateral in trust for the Pledgee for the benefit of the Pledgee and the Bank
Product Providers, and the Pledgor shall promptly surrender and deliver such
Collateral to the Pledgee.

         6. REMEDIES IN CASE OF AN EVENT OF DEFAULT. Upon the occurrence and
during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Pledgee shall be entitled to
exercise all of the rights, powers and remedies (whether vested in it by this
Agreement, the Credit Agreement, any other Loan Documents, and/or in equity or
by law, and including, without limitation, all rights and remedies of a secured
party of a debtor in default under the UCC) for the protection and enforcement
of its rights in respect of the Collateral, and to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable law, the Pledgee shall be entitled, without limitation, to
exercise the following rights, which the Pledgor hereby agrees to be
commercially reasonable:

         (a) to receive all amounts payable in respect of the Collateral
otherwise payable under Section 5 hereof to the Pledgor;

         (b) to transfer all or any part of the Collateral into the Pledgee's
name or the name of its nominee or nominees for the benefit of the Pledgee and
the Bank Product Providers;

         (c) to vote all or any part of the Collateral and otherwise act with
respect thereto as though it were the outright owner thereof;

         (d) at any time or from time to time to sell, assign and deliver, or
grant options to purchase, all or any part of the Collateral in one or more
parcels, or any interest therein, at any public or private sale at any exchange,
broker's board or at any of the Pledgee's offices or elsewhere, without demand
of performance, advertisement or notice of intention to sell or of time or place
of sale or adjournment thereof or to redeem (all of which, except as may be
required by mandatory provisions of applicable law, are hereby expressly and
irrevocably waived by the Pledgor) for cash, on credit or for other property,
for immediate or future delivery without any assumption of credit risk, and for
such price or prices and on such terms as the Pledgee in its absolute discretion
may determine. Pledgor agrees that to the extent that notice of sale shall be
required by law that at least ten (10) calendar days' notice to the Pledgor of
the time (which shall be during normal business hours) and place of any public
sale or the time after which any private sale is to be made shall constitute
reasonable notification. The Pledgee shall not be obligated to make any sale of
Collateral regardless of notice of sale having been given. The Pledgee may
adjourn any public or private sale from time to time by announcement at the time
and place fixed therefor, and any such sale may, without further notice, be made
at the time and place to which it was so adjourned. Pledgor hereby waives and
releases to the fullest extent permitted by law any right or equity of
redemption with respect to the Collateral, whether before or after sale
hereunder, and all rights, if any of marshalling the Collateral and any other
security for the Secured Obligations or otherwise. At any such sale, unless
prohibited by applicable law, the Pledgee may bid for and purchase all or any
part of the Collateral so sold free from any such right or equity of redemption.
Neither the Pledgee nor any of the Bank Product Providers shall be liable for
failure to collect or realize upon any or all of the Collateral or for any delay
in so doing nor shall the Pledgee nor any of the Bank Product Providers be under
any obligation to take any action whatsoever with regard thereto;



                                       -4-
<PAGE>

         (e) to settle, adjust, compromise and arrange all accounts,
controversies, questions, claims and demands whatsoever in relation to all or
any part of the Collateral;

         (f) in respect of the Collateral, to execute all such contracts,
agreements, deeds, documents and instruments, to bring, defend and abandon all
such actions, suits and proceedings, and to take all actions in relation to all
or any part of the Collateral as the Pledgee in its absolute discretion may
determine;

         (g) to appoint managers, sub-agents, officers and servants for any of
the purposes mentioned in the foregoing provisions of this Section and to
dismiss the same, all as the Pledgee in its absolute discretion may determine;
and

         (h) generally, to take all such other action as the Pledgee in its
absolute discretion may determine as incidental or conducive to any of the
matters or powers mentioned in the foregoing provisions of this Section and
which the Pledgee may or can do lawfully and to use the name of the Pledgor for
the purposes aforesaid and in any proceedings arising therefrom.

         7. REMEDIES, ETC., CUMULATIVE. Each right, power and remedy of the
Pledgee (for the benefit of the Pledgee and the Bank Product Providers) provided
for in this Agreement, the Credit Agreement, any Loan Document (as defined in
the Credit Agreement) or any other security agreement, mortgage, guaranty or now
or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute shall be cumulative and
concurrent and shall be in addition to every other such right, power or remedy.
The exercise or beginning of the exercise by the Pledgee (for the benefit of the
Pledgee and the Bank Product Providers) of any one or more of the rights, powers
or remedies provided for in this Agreement, the Credit Agreement, or any other
Loan Document or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute or
otherwise shall not preclude the simultaneous or later exercise by the Pledgee
of all such other rights, powers or remedies, and no failure or delay on the
part of the Pledgee to exercise any such right, power or remedy shall operate as
a waiver thereof.



                                       -5-
<PAGE>

         8. APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS. Subject to any mandatory requirements of
applicable law and the terms of the Credit Agreement, all moneys collected by
the Pledgee (for the benefit of the Pledgee and the Bank Product Providers) upon
sale or other disposition of the Collateral, together with all other moneys
received by the Pledgee hereunder, shall be applied as follows:

         (a) To the payment of any and all costs, expenses and fees (including,
without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements) incurred by
the Pledgee directly or indirectly in connection with such sale or other
disposition, the delivery or taking possession of the Collateral or the
collection of any such moneys;

         (b) Next, to the payment of the Secured Obligations in accordance with
the Credit Agreement; and

         (c) Any surplus then remaining shall be paid to the Pledgor.

         9. INDEMNITY. Without duplication of any amounts payable under any
other similar indemnity provision set forth in the Credit Agreement or any other
Loan Documents, the Pledgor shall: (i) pay all out-of-pocket costs and expenses
of the Pledgee incurred in connection with the administration of and in
connection with the preservation of rights under, and enforcement of, and any
renegotiation or restructuring of this Agreement and any amendment, waiver or
consent relating thereto (including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and
disbursements of counsel for the Pledgee); (ii) pay and hold the Pledgee and the
Bank Product Providers harmless from and against any and all present and future
stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges or
similar levies which arise from any payment made hereunder or from the
execution, delivery or registration of, or otherwise with respect to this
Agreement and save the Pledgee and the Bank Product Providers harmless from and
against any and all liabilities with respect to or resulting from any delay or
omission to pay any such taxes, charges or levies; and (iii) indemnify the
Pledgee and each of the Bank Product Providers, and each of their respective
officers, directors, shareholders, employees, representatives and agents from
and hold each of them harmless against any and all costs, losses, liabilities,
claims, obligations, suits, penalties, judgments, damages or expenses incurred
by or asserted against any of them (whether or not any of them is designated a
party thereto) arising out of or by reason of this Agreement or any transaction
contemplated hereby (including, without limitation, any investigation,
litigation or other proceeding related to this Agreement), including, without
limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel incurred in
connection with any such investigation, litigation or other proceeding. If and
to the extent that the obligations of the Pledgor under this Section are
unenforceable for any reason, the Pledgor hereby agrees to make the maximum
contribution to the payment and satisfaction of such obligations which is
permissible under applicable law. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, the Pledgor shall not be responsible to the Pledgee or any Bank
Product Provider for any costs, losses, damages, liabilities or expenses which
result from the gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of such
Pledgee or any Bank Product Provider. The Pledgor's obligations under this
Section shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

         10. FURTHER ASSURANCES. Pledgor agrees that, at any time and from time
to time, the Pledgor will join with the Pledgee in executing and, at the
Pledgors' own expense, will file and refile under the UCC such financing
statements, continuation statements and other documents in such offices as the
Pledgee may deem necessary or appropriate and wherever required or permitted by
law in order to perfect and preserve the Pledgee's security interest in the
Collateral, and hereby authorizes the Pledgee to file financing statements and
amendments thereto relative to all or any part of the Collateral without the
signature of the Pledgor, and agrees to do such further acts and things and to
promptly execute and deliver to the Pledgee such additional conveyances,
assignments, agreements and instruments as the Pledgee may require or deem
advisable to carry into effect the purpose of this Agreement or to further
assure and confirm unto the Pledgee its rights, powers and remedies hereunder.



                                       -6-
<PAGE>

         11. REASONABLE CARE BY PLEDGEE. The Pledgee shall be deemed by the
Pledgor to have exercised reasonable care in the custody and preservation of the
Collateral in its possession if the Collateral is accorded treatment
substantially equal to that which the Pledgee accords its own similar property.

         12. TRANSFER BY THE PLEDGOR. The Pledgor shall not sell, transfer or
otherwise dispose of, grant any option with respect to, or pledge or otherwise
encumber any of the Collateral or any interest therein.

         13. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE PLEDGOR. Pledgor hereby
represents and warrants to the Pledgee for the benefit of the Pledgee and the
Bank Product Providers, which representations and warranties shall survive the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, as follows:

         13.1 Validity, Perfection and Priority. The pledge and security
interests in the Collateral granted to the Pledgee constitute valid and
continuing security interests in the Collateral. The security interests in the
Collateral granted to the Pledgee for the benefit of the Pledgee and the Bank
Product Providers hereunder constitute valid and perfected security interests
therein superior and prior to the rights or claims of any other person or entity
therein.

         13.2 No Liens; Other Financing Statements.

         (a) The Pledgor is the legal and beneficial owner of, and has good and
marketable title to, the Pledged Collateral.

         (b) No financing statement or other evidence of lien covering or
purporting to cover any of the Collateral is on file in any public office.

<PAGE>

         13.3 Pledged Collateral.

         (a) The Pledged Collateral described in Annex A attached hereto is, and
all other Pledged Collateral in which the Pledgor shall hereafter grant a lien
or security interest pursuant to Section 2 hereof will be, duly authorized,
validly issued, and fully paid, and, except for the pledge provided in Section
3.1 hereof in favor of Pledgee, none of such Pledged Collateral is or will be
subject to any legal or contractual restriction. The Pledged Collateral is, as
of the date hereof, and shall be at all times hereafter during the term of this
Agreement, freely transferable without restriction or limitation (except as
limited by the terms of this Agreement).

         (b) The Pledged Collateral described in Annex A hereto constitutes all
of the issued and outstanding securities and investment property legally and
beneficially owned by the Pledgor on the date hereof in or relating to each of
the Issuers. The Pledgor is the sole shareholder of each of the Issuers.

         13.4 Power and Authority. The Pledgor has the power and authority to
pledge and assign all of the Collateral pursuant to this Agreement. The Pledgor
has executed and delivered this Agreement, and this Agreement constitutes the
legal, valid and binding obligations of the Pledgor, enforceable against the
Pledgor in accordance with the terms herein, except as such enforceability may
be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization and other similar laws
affecting the enforceability of agreements and by general principles of equity.

         13.5 No Violation. Neither the execution, delivery or performance by
the Pledgor of this Agreement, nor compliance with the terms and provisions
hereof by the Pledgor nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby will conflict or be inconsistent with or result in any breach of, any of
the terms, covenants, conditions or provisions of, or constitute a default under
any agreement or other instrument to which Pledgor is a party.

         13.6 Litigation. There are no actions, suits or proceedings pending or,
to the Pledgor's best knowledge, threatened against or involving Pledgor before
any court with respect to any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or the ability of the Pledgor to perform any of the obligations of the Pledgor
hereunder.

         13.7 State of Incorporation. The Pledgor's state of incorporation is
Delaware.

         13.8 Continued Existence. Until any transfer of the Pledged Collateral
to any Person as permitted after an Event of Default in accordance with Section
6 hereof, each of the Issuers shall continue in existence.

         14. COVENANTS OF THE PLEDGOR. Pledgor covenants and agrees with the
Pledgee that on and after the date hereof and until all of the Secured
Obligations shall have been indefeasibly paid in full and this Agreement
terminates in accordance with its terms:



                                       -8-
<PAGE>

         14.1 Collateral. (a) The Pledgor will defend the Pledgee's right, title
and security interest in and to the Collateral against the claims and demands of
all Persons whomsoever; (b) the Pledgor will have good and marketable title to

full power of substitution, in the name of Pledgor upon the occurrence and
during the continuance of an Event of Default (as defined in the Credit
Agreement): (a) to execute and do all such assurances, acts and things which the
Pledgor ought to do but has failed to do under the covenants and provisions
contained in this Agreement; (b) to take any and all such action as the Pledgee
or any of its sub-agents, nominees or attorneys may, in its or their sole and
absolute discretion, reasonably determine as necessary or advisable for the
purpose of maintaining, preserving or protecting the security constituted by
this Agreement or any of the rights, remedies, powers or privileges of the
Pledgee under this Agreement; and (c) generally, in the name of the Pledgor,
exercise all or any of the powers, authorities, and discretions conferred on or
reserved to the Pledgee by or pursuant to this Agreement, and (without prejudice
to the generality of any of the foregoing) to deliver or otherwise perfect any
deed, assurance, agreement, instrument or act as the Pledgee may deem proper in
or for the purpose of exercising any of such powers, authorities or discretions.
Pledgor hereby ratifies and confirms, and hereby agrees to ratify and confirm,
whatever lawful acts the Pledgee or any of the Pledgee's sub-agents or attorneys
shall do or purport to do in the exercise of the power of attorney granted to
the Pledgee pursuant to this Section, which power of attorney, being coupled

         18. MISCELLANEOUS. The Pledgor agrees with the Pledgee that each of the
obligations and liabilities of the Pledgor to the Pledgee under this Agreement
may be enforced against the Pledgor without the necessity of joining any other
Person (as defined in the Credit Agreement) as a party. This Agreement shall
create a continuing security interest in the Collateral and shall be binding
upon the heirs and legal beneficiaries, and permitted successors and assigns, of
the Pledgor, as applicable, and shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable
by the Pledgee and its successors and assigns. Unless otherwise defined herein,

as therein defined. The headings and titles in this Agreement are for
convenience of reference only and shall not limit or define the meaning hereof.
This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which
shall be an original, but all of which shall constitute one instrument. If any
provision of this Agreement shall prove to be invalid or unenforceable, such
provision shall be deemed to be severable from the other provisions of this
Agreement which shall remain binding on all parties hereto. The Pledgor shall
have no rights of subrogation as to any of the Pledged Collateral until full and
complete performance and payment of the Secured Obligations. A faxed signature
hereto shall be deemed to be as legally binding as a signed original.

         19. TERMINATION; RECOVERY CLAIM. This Agreement shall terminate after
the Secured Obligations are indefeasibly paid in full and the Credit Agreement

Agreement, or as otherwise provided in the Credit Agreement, the Pledgee, at the
request of the Pledgor and at the cost and expense of the Pledgor, will promptly
execute and deliver to the Pledgor the proper instruments acknowledging the
termination of this Agreement and will duly assign, transfer and deliver to the
Pledgor or to whomsoever shall be lawfully entitled to receive the same (without
recourse and without any representation or warranty of any kind) such of the
Collateral as may be in the possession of the Pledgee and has not theretofore
been sold or otherwise applied or released pursuant to this Agreement. Should a
claim ("Recovery Claim") be made upon the Pledgee or any or all of the Bank
Product Providers at any time for recovery of any amount received by the Pledgee
or any or all of the Bank Product Providers in payment of the Secured
Obligations (whether received from Pledgor or otherwise) and should the Pledgee

Providers with the claimant (including, without limitation, Pledgor), this

with respect to the amount so repaid to the same extent as if such amount had
never originally been received by the Pledgee or any or all of the Bank Product
Providers, notwithstanding any prior termination of this Agreement, the return
of this Agreement to the Pledgor, or the cancellation of any note or other
instrument evidencing the Secured Obligations.

         20. AMENDMENTS; MARSHALLING, ETC. None of the terms or provisions of
this Agreement may be waived, amended, supplemented or otherwise modified except
by a written instrument executed by the Pledgor and the Pledgee. The Pledgee
shall be under no obligation to marshal any assets or collateral in favor of the
Pledgor or any other person or entity or against or in payment of any or all of
the Secured Obligations. All indemnities set forth herein shall survive the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the making and repayment of the
Secured Obligations. The Bank Product Providers are the intended third party
beneficiaries of this Agreement.

EXHIBIT 10.7



                                PLEDGE AGREEMENT



         THIS PLEDGE AGREEMENT (this "Agreement"), dated as of December 9, 2004,
is made by EASYLINK SERVICES USA, INC., a Delaware corporation ("Pledgor"), in
favor of WELLS FARGO FOOTHILL, INC., a California corporation (together with its
successors and assigns, the "Pledgee").

                                    RECITALS:

         A. Pledgor is the shareholder of the entity listed on Annex A attached
hereto and made a part hereof (the "Issuer").

         B. Pledgor and certain of its Affiliates (each a "Borrower" and
collectively, the "Borrowers") is a party with the Pledgee, to that certain
Credit Agreement of even date herewith (as the same may be amended, supplemented
or modified from time to time, the "Credit Agreement"), pursuant to which the
Pledgor has requested that the Pledgee make certain loans to the Pledgor;
capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed
thereto in the Credit Agreement.

         C. It is a condition precedent to the making of the loans under and
pursuant to the Credit Agreement that the Pledgor execute and deliver this
Agreement and shall have made the pledge contemplated hereunder in favor of the
Pledgee for the benefit of the Pledgee and the Bank Product Providers.

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises hereinabove, and to
induce the Pledgee to make the loans identified hereinabove pursuant to the
Credit Agreement and in consideration of the benefits accruing to the Pledgor,
and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt, adequacy and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Pledgor hereby covenants and
agrees with the Pledgee for the benefit of the Pledgee and the Bank Product
Providers as follows:

         1. INCORPORATION OF CREDIT AGREEMENT; SECURITY FOR OBLIGATIONS. The
Credit Agreement and the terms and provisions thereof are hereby incorporated
herein in their entirety by this reference thereto. All terms capitalized but
not otherwise defined herein shall have the same meanings herein as in the
Credit Agreement. This Agreement is for the benefit of the Pledgee and the Bank
Product Providers to secure the prompt and complete payment and performance when
due of all indebtedness, liabilities, obligations (including the Obligations),
or undertakings owing by the Borrowers to the Pledgee or any Bank Product
Provider, of any kind or description arising out of or outstanding under,
advanced or issued pursuant to, or evidenced by the Credit Agreement, this
Agreement, or any of the other Loan Documents, irrespective of whether for the
payment of money, whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, due or to
become due, voluntary or involuntary, whether now existing or hereafter arising,
and including all interest, costs, indemnities, fees (including attorneys' fees)
and expenses (including interest, costs, indemnities, fees and expenses that,
but for the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, would have accrued irrespective
of whether a claim therefore is allowed) and any and all other amounts which any
Borrower is required to pay pursuant to any of the foregoing, by law, or
otherwise owing by a Borrower to the Pledgee and/or the Bank Product Providers,
including, without limitation, the "Obligations," as defined in the Credit
Agreement (collectively, the "Obligations") (all of the foregoing being herein
collectively called the "Secured Obligations").

<PAGE>

         2. DEFINITION OF PLEDGED COLLATERAL. As used herein, the term "Pledged
Collateral" shall mean the securities and investment property described on Annex
A attached hereto and made a part hereof, and any additional Pledged Collateral
acquired pursuant to Section 3.2 below which Annex A may be supplemented from
time to time pursuant to Section 3.2 below. The Pledgor represents and warrants
to the Pledgee for the benefit of the Pledgee and the Bank Product Providers
that on the date hereof (a) Annex A attached hereto correctly identifies the
Pledged Collateral owned by Pledgor with respect to each of the Issuer; and (b)
the Pledgor is the holder of record and sole beneficial and legal owner of such
Pledged Collateral.

         3. PLEDGE OF PLEDGED COLLATERAL AND OTHER COLLATERAL.

         3.1 Pledge. To secure the Secured Obligations and for the purposes set
forth in Section 1 hereof, Pledgor hereby pledges, collaterally assigns and
conveys, and grants a security interest in and lien on, in favor of Pledgee for
the benefit of the Pledgee and the Bank Product Providers, all of Pledgor's
right, title and interest in, to, and under (A) the Pledged Collateral, (B) any
additional Pledged Collateral acquired pursuant to Section 3.2 below (whether by
purchase, dividend, merger, consolidation, sale of assets, split, spin-off, or
any other dividend or distribution of any kind or otherwise), (C) all
distributions, dividends, cash, certificates, liquidation rights and interests,
options, rights, warrants, instruments or other property from time to time
received, receivable or otherwise distributed in respect of or in exchange or
substitution for any and all of the Pledged Collateral, (D) the Pledgor's right
to vote the Pledged Collateral, and (E) all proceeds, products, replacements and
substitutions for any of the foregoing, in each case whether now owned or
hereafter acquired by the Pledgor (collectively, the "Collateral"). If the
Pledged Collateral is evidenced by certificates, then the Pledgor shall
concurrently herewith deposit with the Pledgee, the Pledged Collateral owned by
the Pledgor on the date hereof and the certificates representing the Pledge
Collateral accompanied by "stock powers" or an Assignment Separate From
Certificate duly executed in blank by the Pledgor. Whether or not the Pledged
Collateral is evidenced by certificates, the Pledgor hereby permits the Pledgee
to file a UCC Financing Statement naming the Pledgor as debtor and the Pledgee
as secured party with respect to the Pledged Collateral with the Delaware
Secretary of State, in form and substance satisfactory to the Pledgee in its
sole and absolute determination, and without the requirement of the Pledgor's
signature. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
the Pledgee shall not as a result of this Agreement be responsible or liable for
any obligations or liabilities of the Pledgor in the Pledgor's capacity as a
shareholder, if any, and the Pledgee shall not be deemed to have assumed any of
such obligations or liabilities.



                                       -2-
<PAGE>

         3.2 Subsequently Acquired Pledged Collateral. If at any time or from
time to time after the date hereof during the term of this Agreement, the
Pledgor shall acquire any additional Pledged Collateral, including any further
stock or equity in each of the Issuer (whether by purchase, dividend, merger,
consolidation, sale of assets, split, spin-off, or any other dividend or
distribution of any kind or otherwise), then the Pledgor will forthwith pledge
and, if applicable, deposit such additional Pledged Collateral with the Pledgee
and deliver to the Pledgee certificates or instruments therefor, endorsed in
blank by the Pledgor or accompanied by "stock powers" or an Assignment Separate
From Certificate duly executed in blank by the Pledgor, and will promptly
thereafter deliver to the Pledgee a certificate (which shall be deemed to
supplement Annex A attached hereto) executed by the Pledgor describing such
Pledged Collateral and the other Pledged Collateral pledged to the Pledgee, and
certifying that the same have been duly pledged with the Pledgee hereunder.
Whether or not such additional Pledged Collateral is evidenced by certificates,
the Pledgor shall permit the Pledgee to file a UCC Financing Statement naming
the Pledgor as debtor and the Pledgee as secured party with respect to the
additional Collateral with the Delaware Secretary of State, in form and
substance satisfactory to the Pledgee in its sole and absolute determination,
and without the requirement of the Pledgor's signature.

         3.3 Uncertificated Pledged Collateral. In addition to anything
contained in Sections 3.1 and 3.2 hereof, if any Pledged Collateral (whether now
owned or hereafter acquired) is not certificated or becomes an uncertificated
security, the Pledgor shall promptly notify the Pledgee thereof and shall
promptly take all actions required to perfect the security interest and pledge
in favor of the Pledgee under applicable law (including, in any event, any
action required or appropriate under this Agreement or the Uniform Commercial
Code of the State of New York or equivalent provisions of any other applicable
jurisdiction (the "UCC")). The Pledgor further agrees to take such actions as
the Pledgee deems necessary or desirable to effectuate the foregoing and to
permit the Pledgee to exercise any of its rights and remedies hereunder.

         4. VOTING, ETC. Unless and until an Event of Default (as defined in the
Credit Agreement) occurs and is continuing, the Pledgor shall be entitled to
vote any and all of the Pledged Collateral; provided, however, that no vote
shall be cast or any action taken by Pledgor which would violate or be
inconsistent with any of the terms of this Agreement, the Credit Agreement, any
other Loan Document or any other instrument or agreement relating to the Secured
Obligations, or which would have the effect of impairing the position or
interests of the Pledgee or which would authorize or effect actions prohibited
under the terms of the Credit Agreement or any Loan Document. All such rights of
the Pledgor to vote shall cease upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, if
the Pledgee so directs and notifies the Pledgor.

         5. PAYMENTS AND OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS. Unless and until an Event of
Default (as defined in the Credit Agreement) shall occur and be continuing, all
cash dividends or distributions payable in respect of the Pledged Collateral (to
the extent such payments shall be permitted pursuant to the terms and provisions
of the Credit Agreement) shall be paid to the Pledgor; provided, however, upon
an Event of Default, all cash dividends or distributions payable in respect of
the Pledged Collateral shall be paid to the Pledgee as security for the Secured
Obligations; provided, further, that all cash dividends and distributions
payable at any time (whether before or after an Event of Default) in respect of
the Pledged Collateral which are determined by Pledgee, in its sole discretion,
to represent in whole or in part an extraordinary, liquidating or other
distribution in return of capital shall be promptly paid and delivered to the
Pledgee and retained by the Pledgee as part of the Collateral. The Pledgee shall
be entitled to receive directly, and to retain as part of the Collateral:



                                       -3-
<PAGE>

         (a) all other or additional securities or investment property, or
rights to subscribe for or purchase any of the foregoing, or property (other
than cash) paid or distributed by way of dividend in respect of the Pledged
Collateral;

         (b) all other or additional securities, investment property or property
(including cash) paid or distributed in respect of the Pledged Collateral by way
of split, spin-off, split-up, reclassification, combination of shares or similar
rearrangement; and

         (c) all other or additional securities, investment property or property
which may be paid in respect of the Collateral by reason of any consolidation,
merger, exchange, dividend, split, or distribution, conveyance of assets,
liquidation or similar reorganization or other disposition of Collateral (to the
extent any of the foregoing actions are permitted under the Credit Agreement).

         If at any time the Pledgor shall obtain or possess any of the foregoing
Collateral described in this Section, the Pledgor shall be deemed to hold such
Collateral in trust for the Pledgee for the benefit of the Pledgee and the Bank
Product Providers, and the Pledgor shall promptly surrender and deliver such
Collateral to the Pledgee.

         6. REMEDIES IN CASE OF AN EVENT OF DEFAULT. Upon the occurrence and
during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Pledgee shall be entitled to
exercise all of the rights, powers and remedies (whether vested in it by this
Agreement, the Credit Agreement, any other Loan Documents, and/or in equity or
by law, and including, without limitation, all rights and remedies of a secured
party of a debtor in default under the UCC) for the protection and enforcement
of its rights in respect of the Collateral, and to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable law, the Pledgee shall be entitled, without limitation, to
exercise the following rights, which the Pledgor hereby agrees to be
commercially reasonable:

         (a) to receive all amounts payable in respect of the Collateral
otherwise payable under Section 5 hereof to the Pledgor;

         (b) to transfer all or any part of the Collateral into the Pledgee's
name or the name of its nominee or nominees for the benefit of the Pledgee and
the Bank Product Providers;

         (c) to vote all or any part of the Collateral and otherwise act with
respect thereto as though it were the outright owner thereof;

         (d) at any time or from time to time to sell, assign and deliver, or
grant options to purchase, all or any part of the Collateral in one or more
parcels, or any interest therein, at any public or private sale at any exchange,
broker's board or at any of the Pledgee's offices or elsewhere, without demand
of performance, advertisement or notice of intention to sell or of time or place
of sale or adjournment thereof or to redeem (all of which, except as may be
required by mandatory provisions of applicable law, are hereby expressly and
irrevocably waived by the Pledgor) for cash, on credit or for other property,
for immediate or future delivery without any assumption of credit risk, and for
such price or prices and on such terms as the Pledgee in its absolute discretion
may determine. Pledgor agrees that to the extent that notice of sale shall be
required by law that at least ten (10) calendar days' notice to the Pledgor of
the time (which shall be during normal business hours) and place of any public
sale or the time after which any private sale is to be made shall constitute
reasonable notification. The Pledgee shall not be obligated to make any sale of
Collateral regardless of notice of sale having been given. The Pledgee may
adjourn any public or private sale from time to time by announcement at the time
and place fixed therefor, and any such sale may, without further notice, be made
at the time and place to which it was so adjourned. Pledgor hereby waives and
releases to the fullest extent permitted by law any right or equity of
redemption with respect to the Collateral, whether before or after sale
hereunder, and all rights, if any of marshalling the Collateral and any other
security for the Secured Obligations or otherwise. At any such sale, unless
prohibited by applicable law, the Pledgee may bid for and purchase all or any
part of the Collateral so sold free from any such right or equity of redemption.
Neither the Pledgee nor any of the Bank Product Providers shall be liable for
failure to collect or realize upon any or all of the Collateral or for any delay
in so doing nor shall the Pledgee nor any of the Bank Product Providers be under
any obligation to take any action whatsoever with regard thereto;



                                       -4-
<PAGE>

         (e) to settle, adjust, compromise and arrange all accounts,
controversies, questions, claims and demands whatsoever in relation to all or
any part of the Collateral;

         (f) in respect of the Collateral, to execute all such contracts,
agreements, deeds, documents and instruments, to bring, defend and abandon all
such actions, suits and proceedings, and to take all actions in relation to all
or any part of the Collateral as the Pledgee in its absolute discretion may
determine;

         (g) to appoint managers, sub-agents, officers and servants for any of
the purposes mentioned in the foregoing provisions of this Section and to
dismiss the same, all as the Pledgee in its absolute discretion may determine;
and

         (h) generally, to take all such other action as the Pledgee in its
absolute discretion may determine as incidental or conducive to any of the
matters or powers mentioned in the foregoing provisions of this Section and
which the Pledgee may or can do lawfully and to use the name of the Pledgor for
the purposes aforesaid and in any proceedings arising therefrom.

         7. REMEDIES, ETC., CUMULATIVE. Each right, power and remedy of the
Pledgee (for the benefit of the Pledgee and the Bank Product Providers) provided
for in this Agreement, the Credit Agreement, any Loan Document (as defined in
the Credit Agreement) or any other security agreement, mortgage, guaranty or now
or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute shall be cumulative and
concurrent and shall be in addition to every other such right, power or remedy.
The exercise or beginning of the exercise by the Pledgee (for the benefit of the
Pledgee and the Bank Product Providers) of any one or more of the rights, powers
or remedies provided for in this Agreement, the Credit Agreement, or any other
Loan Document or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute or
otherwise shall not preclude the simultaneous or later exercise by the Pledgee
of all such other rights, powers or remedies, and no failure or delay on the
part of the Pledgee to exercise any such right, power or remedy shall operate as
a waiver thereof.



                                       -5-
<PAGE>

         8. APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS. Subject to any mandatory requirements of
applicable law and the terms of the Credit Agreement, all moneys collected by
the Pledgee (for the benefit of the Pledgee and the Bank Product Providers) upon
sale or other disposition of the Collateral, together with all other moneys
received by the Pledgee hereunder, shall be applied as follows:

         (a) To the payment of any and all costs, expenses and fees (including,
without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements) incurred by
the Pledgee directly or indirectly in connection with such sale or other
disposition, the delivery or taking possession of the Collateral or the
collection of any such moneys;

         (b) Next, to the payment of the Secured Obligations in accordance with
the Credit Agreement; and

         (c) Any surplus then remaining shall be paid to the Pledgor.

other similar indemnity provision set forth in the Credit Agreement or any other

of the Pledgee incurred in connection with the administration of and in
connection with the preservation of rights under, and enforcement of, and any
renegotiation or restructuring of this Agreement and any amendment, waiver or
consent relating thereto (including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and
disbursements of counsel for the Pledgee); (ii) pay and hold the Pledgee and the
Bank Product Providers harmless from and against any and all present and future
stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges or

Agreement and save the Pledgee and the Bank Product Providers harmless from and
against any and all liabilities with respect to or resulting from any delay or
omission to pay any such taxes, charges or levies; and (iii) indemnify the
Pledgee and each of the Bank Product Providers, and each of their respective
officers, directors, shareholders, employees, representatives and agents from
and hold each of them harmless against any and all costs, losses, liabilities,
claims, obligations, suits, penalties, judgments, damages or expenses incurred
by or asserted against any of them (whether or not any of them is designated a
party thereto) arising out of or by reason of this Agreement or any transaction
contemplated hereby (including, without limitation, any investigation,
litigation or other proceeding related to this Agreement), including, without
limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel incurred in
connection with any such investigation, litigation or other proceeding. If and
to the extent that the obligations of the Pledgor under this Section are
unenforceable for any reason, the Pledgor hereby agrees to make the maximum
contribution to the payment and satisfaction of such obligations which is
permissible under applicable law. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, the Pledgor shall not be responsible to the Pledgee or any Bank
Product Provider for any costs, losses, damages, liabilities or expenses which
result from the gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of such
Pledgee or any Bank Product Provider. The Pledgor's obligations under this
Section shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

to time, the Pledgor will join with the Pledgee in executing and, at the
Pledgors' own expense, will file and refile under the UCC such financing

Pledgee may deem necessary or appropriate and wherever required or permitted by
law in order to perfect and preserve the Pledgee's security interest in the
Collateral, and hereby authorizes the Pledgee to file financing statements and
amendments thereto relative to all or any part of the Collateral without the
signature of the Pledgor, and agrees to do such further acts and things and to
promptly execute and deliver to the Pledgee such additional conveyances,
assignments, agreements and instruments as the Pledgee may require or deem
advisable to carry into effect the purpose of this Agreement or to further
assure and confirm unto the Pledgee its rights, powers and remedies hereunder.

         11. REASONABLE CARE BY PLEDGEE. The Pledgee shall be deemed by the
Pledgor to have exercised reasonable care in the custody and preservation of the
Collateral in its possession if the Collateral is accorded treatment
substantially equal to that which the Pledgee accords its own similar property.

         12. TRANSFER BY THE PLEDGOR. Except with respect to the Infocrossing
Stock Sale and as otherwise permitted hereunder and under the other Loan
Documents, the Pledgor shall not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of, grant
any option with respect to, or pledge or otherwise encumber any of the
Collateral or any interest therein.

         13. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE PLEDGOR. Pledgor hereby
represents and warrants to the Pledgee for the benefit of the Pledgee and the
Bank Product Providers, which representations and warranties shall survive the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, as follows:

         13.1 Validity, Perfection and Priority. The pledge and security
interests in the Collateral granted to the Pledgee constitute valid and
continuing security interests in the Collateral. The security interests in the

         14.9 Stay or Extension Laws. The Pledgor will not at any time claim,

         17. POWER OF ATTORNEY. Pledgor hereby absolutely and irrevocably
constitutes and appoints the Pledgee for the benefit of the Pledgee and the Bank
Product Providers as Pledgor's true and lawful agent and attorney-in-fact with
full power of substitution, in the name of Pledgor upon the occurrence and
during the continuance of an Event of Default (as defined in the Credit
Agreement): (a) to execute and do all such assurances, acts and things which the
Pledgor ought to do but has failed to do under the covenants and provisions
contained in this Agreement; (b) to take any and all such action as the Pledgee
or any of its sub-agents, nominees or attorneys may, in its or their sole and
absolute discretion, reasonably determine as necessary or advisable for the
purpose of maintaining, preserving or protecting the security constituted by
this Agreement or any of the rights, remedies, powers or privileges of the
Pledgee under this Agreement; and (c) generally, in the name of the Pledgor,
exercise all or any of the powers, authorities, and discretions conferred on or
reserved to the Pledgee by or pursuant to this Agreement, and (without prejudice
to the generality of any of the foregoing) to deliver or otherwise perfect any
deed, assurance, agreement, instrument or act as the Pledgee may deem proper in
or for the purpose of exercising any of such powers, authorities or discretions.
Pledgor hereby ratifies and confirms, and hereby agrees to ratify and confirm,
whatever lawful acts the Pledgee or any of the Pledgee's sub-agents or attorneys
shall do or purport to do in the exercise of the power of attorney granted to
the Pledgee pursuant to this Section, which power of attorney, being coupled
with an interest and given for security, is irrevocable.

         18. MISCELLANEOUS. The Pledgor agrees with the Pledgee that each of the
obligations and liabilities of the Pledgor to the Pledgee under this Agreement
may be enforced against the Pledgor without the necessity of joining any other
Person (as defined in the Credit Agreement) as a party. This Agreement shall
create a continuing security interest in the Collateral and shall be binding
upon the heirs and legal beneficiaries, and permitted successors and assigns, of
the Pledgor, as applicable, and shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable
by the Pledgee and its successors and assigns. Unless otherwise defined herein,
terms defined in the UCC as in effect in the State of New York are used herein
as therein defined. The headings and titles in this Agreement are for
convenience of reference only and shall not limit or define the meaning hereof.
This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which
shall be an original, but all of which shall constitute one instrument. If any
provision of this Agreement shall prove to be invalid or unenforceable, such
provision shall be deemed to be severable from the other provisions of this
Agreement which shall remain binding on all parties hereto. The Pledgor shall
have no rights of subrogation as to any of the Pledged Collateral until full and
complete performance and payment of the Secured Obligations. A faxed signature
hereto shall be deemed to be as legally binding as a signed original.

         19. TERMINATION; RECOVERY CLAIM. This Agreement shall terminate after
the Secured Obligations are indefeasibly paid in full and the Credit Agreement
is terminated in accordance with its terms. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
immediately prior to the Infocrossing Stock Sale, the Pledgee agrees to release
its pledge in that portion of the Pledged Collateral constituting the
Infocrossing Stock in order to permit the Pledgor to consummate such transaction
subject in all respects to the terms and provisions contained in the Credit
Agreement. Upon the termination of this Agreement, or as otherwise provided in
the Credit Agreement, the Pledgee, at the request of the Pledgor and at the cost
and expense of the Pledgor, will promptly execute and deliver to the Pledgor the
proper instruments acknowledging the termination of this Agreement and will duly
assign, transfer and deliver to the Pledgor or to whomsoever shall be lawfully
entitled to receive the same (without recourse and without any representation or
warranty of any kind) such of the Collateral as may be in the possession of the
Pledgee and has not theretofore been sold or otherwise applied or released
pursuant to this Agreement. Should a claim ("Recovery Claim") be made upon the
Pledgee or any or all of the Bank Product Providers at any time for recovery of
any amount received by the Pledgee or any or all of the Bank Product Providers
in payment of the Secured Obligations (whether received from Pledgor or
otherwise) and should the Pledgee or any or all of the Bank Product Providers
repay all or part of said amount by reason of (a) any judgment, decree or order
of any court or administrative body having jurisdiction over the Pledgee or any
or all of the Bank Product Providers or any of their respective property; or (b)
any settlement or compromise of any such Recovery Claim effected by the Pledgee
or any or all of the Bank Product Providers with the claimant (including,
without limitation, Pledgor), this Agreement and the security interests granted
to the Pledgee for the benefit of the Pledgee and the Bank Product Providers
hereunder shall continue in effect with respect to the amount so repaid to the
same extent as if such amount had never originally been received by the Pledgee
or any or all of the Bank Product Providers, notwithstanding any prior
termination of this Agreement, the return of this Agreement to the Pledgor, or
the cancellation of any note or other instrument evidencing the Secured
Obligations.

         20. AMENDMENTS; MARSHALLING, ETC. None of the terms or provisions of
this Agreement may be waived, amended, supplemented or otherwise modified except
by a written instrument executed by the Pledgor and the Pledgee. The Pledgee
shall be under no obligation to marshal any assets or collateral in favor of the
Pledgor or any other person or entity or against or in payment of any or all of
the Secured Obligations. All indemnities set forth herein shall survive the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the making and repayment of the

EXHIBIT 10.8



                                PLEDGE AGREEMENT



         THIS PLEDGE AGREEMENT (this "Agreement"), dated as of December 9, 2004,
is made by SWIFT TELECOMMUNICATIONS, INC., a Delaware corporation ("Pledgor"),
in favor of WELLS FARGO FOOTHILL, INC., a California corporation (together with
its successors and assigns, the "Pledgee").

                                    RECITALS:

         A. Pledgor is the sole shareholder of the entities (1) listed on Annex
A-1 attached hereto and made a part hereof (collectively, the "Domestic
Issuers") and (2) listed on Annex A-2 attached hereto and made a part hereof
(collectively, the "Foreign Issuers"). The Domestic Issuers and the Foreign
Issuers are collectively referred to as the "Issuers."

         B. Pledgor and certain of its Affiliates (each a "Borrower" and
collectively, the "Borrowers") is a party with the Pledgee, to that certain
Credit Agreement of even date herewith (as the same may be amended, supplemented
or modified from time to time, the "Credit Agreement"), pursuant to which the
Pledgor has requested that the Pledgee make certain loans to the Pledgor;
capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed
thereto in the Credit Agreement.

         C. It is a condition precedent to the making of the loans under and
pursuant to the Credit Agreement that the Pledgor execute and deliver this
Agreement and shall have made the pledge contemplated hereunder in favor of the
Pledgee for the benefit of the Pledgee and the Bank Product Providers.

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises hereinabove, and to
induce the Pledgee to make the loans identified hereinabove pursuant to the
Credit Agreement and in consideration of the benefits accruing to the Pledgor,
and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt, adequacy and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Pledgor hereby covenants and
agrees with the Pledgee for the benefit of the Pledgee and the Bank Product
Providers as follows:

         1. INCORPORATION OF CREDIT AGREEMENT; SECURITY FOR OBLIGATIONS. The
Credit Agreement and the terms and provisions thereof are hereby incorporated
herein in their entirety by this reference thereto. All terms capitalized but
not otherwise defined herein shall have the same meanings herein as in the
Credit Agreement. This Agreement is for the benefit of the Pledgee and the Bank
Product Providers to secure the prompt and complete payment and performance when
due of all indebtedness, liabilities, obligations (including the Obligations),
or undertakings owing by the Borrowers to the Pledgee or any Bank Product
Provider, of any kind or description arising out of or outstanding under,
advanced or issued pursuant to, or evidenced by the Credit Agreement, this
Agreement, or any of the other Loan Documents, irrespective of whether for the
payment of money, whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, due or to
become due, voluntary or involuntary, whether now existing or hereafter arising,
and including all interest, costs, indemnities, fees (including attorneys' fees)
and expenses (including interest, costs, indemnities, fees and expenses that,
but for the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, would have accrued irrespective
of whether a claim therefore is allowed) and any and all other amounts which any
Borrower is required to pay pursuant to any of the foregoing, by law, or
otherwise owing by a Borrower to the Pledgee and/or the Bank Product Providers,
including, without limitation, the "Obligations," as defined in the Credit
Agreement (collectively, the "Obligations") (all of the foregoing being herein
collectively called the "Secured Obligations").


<PAGE>

         2. DEFINITION OF PLEDGED COLLATERAL. As used herein, the term "Pledged
Collateral" shall mean the securities and investment property described on
Annexes A-1 and 2 attached hereto and made a part hereof, and any additional
Pledged Collateral acquired pursuant to Section 3.2 below which Annexes A-1 and
2 may be supplemented from time to time pursuant to Section 3.2 below. The
Pledgor represents and warrants to the Pledgee for the benefit of the Pledgee
and the Bank Product Providers that on the date hereof (a) Annexes A-1 and 2
attached hereto correctly identifies the Pledged Collateral owned by Pledgor
with respect to each of the Issuers; and (b) the Pledgor is the holder of record
and sole beneficial and legal owner of such Pledged Collateral.

         3. PLEDGE OF PLEDGED COLLATERAL AND OTHER COLLATERAL.

         3.1 Pledge. To secure the Secured Obligations and for the purposes set
forth in Section 1 hereof, Pledgor hereby pledges, collaterally assigns and
conveys, and grants a security interest in and lien on, in favor of Pledgee for
the benefit of the Pledgee and the Bank Product Providers, all of Pledgor's
right, title and interest in, to, and under (A) the Pledged Collateral, (B) any
additional Pledged Collateral acquired pursuant to Section 3.2 below (whether by
purchase, dividend, merger, consolidation, sale of assets, split, spin-off, or
any other dividend or distribution of any kind or otherwise), (C) all
distributions, dividends, cash, certificates, liquidation rights and interests,
options, rights, warrants, instruments or other property from time to time
received, receivable or otherwise distributed in respect of or in exchange or
substitution for any and all of the Pledged Collateral, (D) the Pledgor's right
to vote the Pledged Collateral, and (E) all proceeds, products, replacements and
substitutions for any of the foregoing, in each case whether now owned or
hereafter acquired by the Pledgor (collectively, the "Collateral"). If the
Pledged Collateral is evidenced by certificates, then the Pledgor shall
concurrently herewith deposit with the Pledgee, the Pledged Collateral owned by
the Pledgor on the date hereof and the certificates representing the Pledge
Collateral accompanied by "stock powers" or an Assignment Separate From
Certificate duly executed in blank by the Pledgor. Whether or not the Pledged
Collateral is evidenced by certificates, the Pledgor hereby permits the Pledgee
to file a UCC Financing Statement naming the Pledgor as debtor and the Pledgee
as secured party with respect to the Pledged Collateral with the Delaware
Secretary of State, in form and substance satisfactory to the Pledgee in its
sole and absolute determination, and without the requirement of the Pledgor's
signature. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
the Pledgee shall not as a result of this Agreement be responsible or liable for
any obligations or liabilities of the Pledgor in the Pledgor's capacity as a
shareholder, if any, and the Pledgee shall not be deemed to have assumed any of
such obligations or liabilities.



                                       -2-
<PAGE>

         3.2 Subsequently Acquired Pledged Collateral. If at any time or from
time to time after the date hereof during the term of this Agreement, the
Pledgor shall acquire any additional Pledged Collateral, including any further
stock or equity in each of the Issuers (whether by purchase, dividend, merger,
consolidation, sale of assets, split, spin-off, or any other dividend or
distribution of any kind or otherwise), then the Pledgor will forthwith pledge
and, if applicable, deposit such additional Pledged Collateral with the Pledgee
and deliver to the Pledgee certificates or instruments therefor, endorsed in
blank by the Pledgor or accompanied by "stock powers" or an Assignment Separate
From Certificate duly executed in blank by the Pledgor, and will promptly
thereafter deliver to the Pledgee a certificate (which shall be deemed to
supplement Annexes A-1 and 2 attached hereto) executed by the Pledgor describing
such Pledged Collateral and the other Pledged Collateral pledged to the Pledgee,
and certifying that the same have been duly pledged with the Pledgee hereunder;
provided, however, that under no circumstances shall the Pledgor pledge an
amount greater than 66 2/3% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of any
Foreign Issuer. Whether or not such additional Pledged Collateral is evidenced
by certificates, the Pledgor shall permit the Pledgee to file a UCC Financing
Statement naming the Pledgor as debtor and the Pledgee as secured party with
respect to the additional Collateral with the Delaware Secretary of State, in
form and substance satisfactory to the Pledgee in its sole and absolute
determination, and without the requirement of the Pledgor's signature.

         3.3 Uncertificated Pledged Collateral. In addition to anything
contained in Sections 3.1 and 3.2 hereof, if any Pledged Collateral (whether now
owned or hereafter acquired) is not certificated or becomes an uncertificated
security, the Pledgor shall promptly notify the Pledgee thereof and shall
promptly take all actions required to perfect the security interest and pledge
in favor of the Pledgee under applicable law (including, in any event, any
action required or appropriate under this Agreement or the Uniform Commercial
Code of the State of New York or equivalent provisions of any other applicable
jurisdiction (the "UCC")). The Pledgor further agrees to take such actions as
the Pledgee deems necessary or desirable to effectuate the foregoing and to
permit the Pledgee to exercise any of its rights and remedies hereunder.

         4. VOTING, ETC. Unless and until an Event of Default (as defined in the
Credit Agreement) occurs and is continuing, the Pledgor shall be entitled to
vote any and all of the Pledged Collateral; provided, however, that no vote
shall be cast or any action taken by Pledgor which would violate or be
inconsistent with any of the terms of this Agreement, the Credit Agreement, any
other Loan Document or any other instrument or agreement relating to the Secured
Obligations, or which would have the effect of impairing the position or
interests of the Pledgee or which would authorize or effect actions prohibited
under the terms of the Credit Agreement or any Loan Document. All such rights of
the Pledgor to vote shall cease upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, if
the Pledgee so directs and notifies the Pledgor.

         5. PAYMENTS AND OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS. Unless and until an Event of
Default (as defined in the Credit Agreement) shall occur and be continuing, all
cash dividends or distributions payable in respect of the Pledged Collateral (to
the extent such payments shall be permitted pursuant to the terms and provisions
of the Credit Agreement) shall be paid to the Pledgor; provided, however, upon
an Event of Default, all cash dividends or distributions payable in respect of
the Pledged Collateral shall be paid to the Pledgee as security for the Secured
Obligations; provided, further, that all cash dividends and distributions
payable at any time (whether before or after an Event of Default) in respect of
the Pledged Collateral which are determined by Pledgee, in its sole discretion,
to represent in whole or in part an extraordinary, liquidating or other
distribution in return of capital shall be promptly paid and delivered to the
Pledgee and retained by the Pledgee as part of the Collateral. The Pledgee shall
be entitled to receive directly, and to retain as part of the Collateral:



                                       -3-
<PAGE>

         (a) all other or additional securities or investment property, or
rights to subscribe for or purchase any of the foregoing, or property (other
than cash) paid or distributed by way of dividend in respect of the Pledged
Collateral;

         (b) all other or additional securities, investment property or property
(including cash) paid or distributed in respect of the Pledged Collateral by way
of split, spin-off, split-up, reclassification, combination of shares or similar
rearrangement; and

         (c) all other or additional securities, investment property or property
which may be paid in respect of the Collateral by reason of any consolidation,
merger, exchange, dividend, split, or distribution, conveyance of assets,
liquidation or similar reorganization or other disposition of Collateral (to the
extent any of the foregoing actions are permitted under the Credit Agreement).

         If at any time the Pledgor shall obtain or possess any of the foregoing
Collateral described in this Section, the Pledgor shall be deemed to hold such
Collateral in trust for the Pledgee for the benefit of the Pledgee and the Bank
Product Providers, and the Pledgor shall promptly surrender and deliver such
Collateral to the Pledgee.

         6. REMEDIES IN CASE OF AN EVENT OF DEFAULT. Upon the occurrence and
during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Pledgee shall be entitled to
exercise all of the rights, powers and remedies (whether vested in it by this
Agreement, the Credit Agreement, any other Loan Documents, and/or in equity or
by law, and including, without limitation, all rights and remedies of a secured
party of a debtor in default under the UCC) for the protection and enforcement
of its rights in respect of the Collateral, and to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable law, the Pledgee shall be entitled, without limitation, to
exercise the following rights, which the Pledgor hereby agrees to be
commercially reasonable:

         (a) to receive all amounts payable in respect of the Collateral
otherwise payable under Section 5 hereof to the Pledgor;

         (b) to transfer all or any part of the Collateral into the Pledgee's
name or the name of its nominee or nominees for the benefit of the Pledgee and
the Bank Product Providers;

         (c) to vote all or any part of the Collateral and otherwise act with
respect thereto as though it were the outright owner thereof;

         (d) at any time or from time to time to sell, assign and deliver, or
grant options to purchase, all or any part of the Collateral in one or more
parcels, or any interest therein, at any public or private sale at any exchange,
broker's board or at any of the Pledgee's offices or elsewhere, without demand
of performance, advertisement or notice of intention to sell or of time or place
of sale or adjournment thereof or to redeem (all of which, except as may be
required by mandatory provisions of applicable law, are hereby expressly and
irrevocably waived by the Pledgor) for cash, on credit or for other property,
for immediate or future delivery without any assumption of credit risk, and for
such price or prices and on such terms as the Pledgee in its absolute discretion
may determine. Pledgor agrees that to the extent that notice of sale shall be
required by law that at least ten (10) calendar days' notice to the Pledgor of
the time (which shall be during normal business hours) and place of any public
sale or the time after which any private sale is to be made shall constitute
reasonable notification. The Pledgee shall not be obligated to make any sale of
Collateral regardless of notice of sale having been given. The Pledgee may
adjourn any public or private sale from time to time by announcement at the time
and place fixed therefor, and any such sale may, without further notice, be made
at the time and place to which it was so adjourned. Pledgor hereby waives and
releases to the fullest extent permitted by law any right or equity of
redemption with respect to the Collateral, whether before or after sale
hereunder, and all rights, if any of marshalling the Collateral and any other
security for the Secured Obligations or otherwise. At any such sale, unless
prohibited by applicable law, the Pledgee may bid for and purchase all or any
part of the Collateral so sold free from any such right or equity of redemption.
Neither the Pledgee nor any of the Bank Product Providers shall be liable for
failure to collect or realize upon any or all of the Collateral or for any delay
in so doing nor shall the Pledgee nor any of the Bank Product Providers be under
any obligation to take any action whatsoever with regard thereto;



                                       -4-
<PAGE>

         (e) to settle, adjust, compromise and arrange all accounts,
controversies, questions, claims and demands whatsoever in relation to all or
any part of the Collateral;

         (f) in respect of the Collateral, to execute all such contracts,
agreements, deeds, documents and instruments, to bring, defend and abandon all
such actions, suits and proceedings, and to take all actions in relation to all
or any part of the Collateral as the Pledgee in its absolute discretion may
determine;

         (g) to appoint managers, sub-agents, officers and servants for any of
the purposes mentioned in the foregoing provisions of this Section and to
dismiss the same, all as the Pledgee in its absolute discretion may determine;
and

         (h) generally, to take all such other action as the Pledgee in its
absolute discretion may determine as incidental or conducive to any of the
matters or powers mentioned in the foregoing provisions of this Section and
which the Pledgee may or can do lawfully and to use the name of the Pledgor for
the purposes aforesaid and in any proceedings arising therefrom.

         7. REMEDIES, ETC., CUMULATIVE. Each right, power and remedy of the
Pledgee (for the benefit of the Pledgee and the Bank Product Providers) provided
for in this Agreement, the Credit Agreement, any Loan Document (as defined in
the Credit Agreement) or any other security agreement, mortgage, guaranty or now
or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute shall be cumulative and
concurrent and shall be in addition to every other such right, power or remedy.
The exercise or beginning of the exercise by the Pledgee (for the benefit of the
Pledgee and the Bank Product Providers) of any one or more of the rights, powers
or remedies provided for in this Agreement, the Credit Agreement, or any other
Loan Document or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute or
otherwise shall not preclude the simultaneous or later exercise by the Pledgee
of all such other rights, powers or remedies, and no failure or delay on the
part of the Pledgee to exercise any such right, power or remedy shall operate as
a waiver thereof.



                                       -5-
<PAGE>

         8. APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS. Subject to any mandatory requirements of
applicable law and the terms of the Credit Agreement, all moneys collected by
the Pledgee (for the benefit of the Pledgee and the Bank Product Providers) upon
sale or other disposition of the Collateral, together with all other moneys
received by the Pledgee hereunder, shall be applied as follows:

         (a) To the payment of any and all costs, expenses and fees (including,
without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements) incurred by
the Pledgee directly or indirectly in connection with such sale or other
disposition, the delivery or taking possession of the Collateral or the
collection of any such moneys;

         (b) Next, to the payment of the Secured Obligations in accordance with
the Credit Agreement; and

         (c) Any surplus then remaining shall be paid to the Pledgor.

         9. INDEMNITY. Without duplication of any amounts payable under any
other similar indemnity provision set forth in the Credit Agreement or any other
Loan Documents, the Pledgor shall: (i) pay all out-of-pocket costs and expenses
of the Pledgee incurred in connection with the administration of and in
connection with the preservation of rights under, and enforcement of, and any
renegotiation or restructuring of this Agreement and any amendment, waiver or
consent relating thereto (including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and
disbursements of counsel for the Pledgee); (ii) pay and hold the Pledgee and the
Bank Product Providers harmless from and against any and all present and future
stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges or
similar levies which arise from any payment made hereunder or from the
execution, delivery or registration of, or otherwise with respect to this
Agreement and save the Pledgee and the Bank Product Providers harmless from and
against any and all liabilities with respect to or resulting from any delay or
omission to pay any such taxes, charges or levies; and (iii) indemnify the
Pledgee and each of the Bank Product Providers, and each of their respective
officers, directors, shareholders, employees, representatives and agents from
and hold each of them harmless against any and all costs, losses, liabilities,
claims, obligations, suits, penalties, judgments, damages or expenses incurred
by or asserted against any of them (whether or not any of them is designated a
party thereto) arising out of or by reason of this Agreement or any transaction
contemplated hereby (including, without limitation, any investigation,
litigation or other proceeding related to this Agreement), including, without
limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel incurred in
connection with any such investigation, litigation or other proceeding. If and
to the extent that the obligations of the Pledgor under this Section are
unenforceable for any reason, the Pledgor hereby agrees to make the maximum
contribution to the payment and satisfaction of such obligations which is
permissible under applicable law. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, the Pledgor shall not be responsible to the Pledgee or any Bank
Product Provider for any costs, losses, damages, liabilities or expenses which
result from the gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of such
Pledgee or any Bank Product Provider. The Pledgor's obligations under this
Section shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

<PAGE>

         10. FURTHER ASSURANCES. Pledgor agrees that, at any time and from time
to time, the Pledgor will join with the Pledgee in executing and, at the
Pledgors' own expense, will file and refile under the UCC such financing
statements, continuation statements and other documents in such offices as the
Pledgee may deem necessary or appropriate and wherever required or permitted by
law in order to perfect and preserve the Pledgee's security interest in the
Collateral, and hereby authorizes the Pledgee to file financing statements and
amendments thereto relative to all or any part of the Collateral without the
signature of the Pledgor, and agrees to do such further acts and things and to
promptly execute and deliver to the Pledgee such additional conveyances,
assignments, agreements and instruments as the Pledgee may require or deem
advisable to carry into effect the purpose of this Agreement or to further
assure and confirm unto the Pledgee its rights, powers and remedies hereunder.

         11. REASONABLE CARE BY PLEDGEE. The Pledgee shall be deemed by the
Pledgor to have exercised reasonable care in the custody and preservation of the
Collateral in its possession if the Collateral is accorded treatment
substantially equal to that which the Pledgee accords its own similar property.

         12. TRANSFER BY THE PLEDGOR. Except with respect to the Infocrossing
Stock Sale and as otherwise permitted hereunder and under the other Loan
Documents, the Pledgor shall not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of, grant
any option with respect to, or pledge or otherwise encumber any of the
Collateral or any interest therein.

         13. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE PLEDGOR. Pledgor hereby
represents and warrants to the Pledgee for the benefit of the Pledgee and the
Bank Product Providers, which representations and warranties shall survive the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, as follows:

         13.1 Validity, Perfection and Priority. The pledge and security
interests in the Collateral granted to the Pledgee constitute valid and
continuing security interests in the Collateral. The security interests in the
Collateral granted to the Pledgee for the benefit of the Pledgee and the Bank
Product Providers hereunder constitute valid and perfected security interests
therein superior and prior to the rights or claims of any other person or entity
therein.

         13.2 No Liens; Other Financing Statements.

         (a) The Pledgor is the legal and beneficial owner of, and has good and
marketable title to, the Pledged Collateral.

purporting to cover any of the Collateral is on file in any public office.

during the continuance of an Event of Default (as defined in the Credit
Agreement): (a) to execute and do all such assurances, acts and things which the
Pledgor ought to do but has failed to do under the covenants and provisions
contained in this Agreement; (b) to take any and all such action as the Pledgee
or any of its sub-agents, nominees or attorneys may, in its or their sole and
absolute discretion, reasonably determine as necessary or advisable for the
purpose of maintaining, preserving or protecting the security constituted by
this Agreement or any of the rights, remedies, powers or privileges of the
Pledgee under this Agreement; and (c) generally, in the name of the Pledgor,
exercise all or any of the powers, authorities, and discretions conferred on or
reserved to the Pledgee by or pursuant to this Agreement, and (without prejudice
to the generality of any of the foregoing) to deliver or otherwise perfect any
deed, assurance, agreement, instrument or act as the Pledgee may deem proper in
or for the purpose of exercising any of such powers, authorities or discretions.
Pledgor hereby ratifies and confirms, and hereby agrees to ratify and confirm,
whatever lawful acts the Pledgee or any of the Pledgee's sub-agents or attorneys
shall do or purport to do in the exercise of the power of attorney granted to
the Pledgee pursuant to this Section, which power of attorney, being coupled

         18. MISCELLANEOUS. The Pledgor agrees with the Pledgee that each of the

create a continuing security interest in the Collateral and shall be binding
upon the heirs and legal beneficiaries, and permitted successors and assigns, of
the Pledgor, as applicable, and shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable

complete performance and payment of the Secured Obligations. A faxed signature
hereto shall be deemed to be as legally binding as a signed original.

request of the Pledgor and at the cost and expense of the Pledgor, will promptly
execute and deliver to the Pledgor the proper instruments acknowledging the
termination of this Agreement and will duly assign, transfer and deliver to the

with respect to the amount so repaid to the same extent as if such amount had
never originally been received by the Pledgee or any or all of the Bank Product
Providers, notwithstanding any prior termination of this Agreement, the return
of this Agreement to the Pledgor, or the cancellation of any note or other
instrument evidencing the Secured Obligations.

this Agreement may be waived, amended, supplemented or otherwise modified except
by a written instrument executed by the Pledgor and the Pledgee. The Pledgee
shall be under no obligation to marshal any assets or collateral in favor of the
Pledgor or any other person or entity or against or in payment of any or all of
the Secured Obligations. All indemnities set forth herein shall survive the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the making and repayment of the
Secured Obligations. The Bank Product Providers are the intended third party
beneficiaries of this Agreement.

         (vi) all trade secrets, formulas, processes, devices, know-how, or

unauthorized disclosures thereof and all rights corresponding thereto throughout
the world (all of the foregoing trade secrets and associated rights are

                  3. Representations and Warranties. Assignor hereby represents

                  5. New Intellectual Property. Assignor hereby represents and
         warrants to Assignee for the benefit of the Assignee and the Bank
         Product Providers that the Intellectual Property listed on Exhibits A,
         B, C, and D, respectively, constitute all of the Intellectual Property
         material to the Assignor's business and now owned by Assignor. If,
         before all Obligations shall have been satisfied in full or before the
         Credit Agreement has been terminated, Assignor shall (i) become aware
         of any existing Intellectual Property material to the Assignor's
         business of which Assignor has not previously informed Assignee, (ii)
         obtain rights to any new patentable inventions or other Intellectual
         Property material to the Assignor's business, or (iii) become entitled
         to the benefit of any Intellectual Property material to the Assignor's
         business which benefit is not in existence on the date hereof, the
         provisions of this Security Agreement above shall automatically apply
         thereto and Assignor shall give to Assignee prompt written notice
         thereof. Assignor hereby authorizes Assignee to modify this Security
         Agreement by amending Exhibits A, B, C, and D, as applicable, to
         include any such Intellectual Property, and to file or refile this
         Security Agreement with the U.S Patent and Trademark Office and U.S.
         Copyright Office. Assignor agrees to execute and deliver any and all
         documents and instruments necessary or advisable to record or preserve
         Assignee's interest in all Intellectual Property added to Exhibits A,
         B, C, and D pursuant to this Section.

                  6. Royalties; Terms; Rights Upon Default. The term of this
         Security Agreement shall extend until the earlier of (i) the expiration
         of all of the respective Intellectual Property collaterally assigned
         hereunder, and (ii) the indefeasible payment in full of all Obligations
         and the termination of the Credit Agreement. Assignor agrees that upon
         the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, the
         use by Assignee for the benefit of the Assignee and the Bank Product
         Providers of all Intellectual Property shall be worldwide and as
         extensive as the rights of Assignor to use such Intellectual Property,
         and without any liability for royalties or other related charges from
         Assignee or the Bank Product Providers to Assignor. Upon the occurrence
         and during the continuance of any Event of Default, Assignor hereby
         authorizes: (a) the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks, United
         States Patent and Trademark Office (or as appropriate, such equivalent
         agency in foreign countries), to issue any and all Patents to Assignee
         for the benefit of the Assignee and the Bank Product Providers as
         assignee of Assignor's entire interest therein; (b) the Register of
         Copyrights, United States Copyright Office (or as appropriate, such
         equivalent agency in foreign countries), to issue any and all
         certificates of registration or renewal for all of the Copyrights to
         Assignee for the benefit of the Assignee and the Bank Product Providers
         as assignee of Assignor's entire interest therein; and (c) the
         Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks, United States Patent and
         Trademark Office (or as appropriate, such equivalent agency in foreign
         countries) to issue any and all certificates of registration or renewal
         for all of the Trademarks to Assignee for the benefit of the Assignee
         and the Bank Product Providers as assignee of Assignor's entire
         interest therein and in the goodwill of Assignor's business connected
         therewith and symbolized thereby.

                  7. Assignee's Right to Inspect; Trademark Quality Control.
         Assignee shall have the right, at any time and from time to time with
         prior notice (unless an Event of Default has occurred and is
         continuing, in which case prior notice shall not be required) and,
         during normal business hours and prior to payment in full of all
         Obligations and termination of the Credit Agreement, to inspect
         Assignor's premises and to examine Assignor's books, records and
         operations, including, without limitation, Assignor's quality control
         processes. Assignor agrees (i) to maintain the quality of any and all
         products in connection with which the Trademarks are used, consistent
         with the quality of said products as of the date hereof and (ii) to
         provide Assignee, upon Assignee's reasonable request from time to time,
         with a certificate of an officer of Assignor certifying Assignor's
         compliance with the foregoing. Upon the occurrence and during the
         continuance of an Event of Default, Assignor agrees that Assignee, or a
         conservator appointed by Assignee, shall have the right to establish
         such additional product quality controls as Assignee, or said
         conservator, in its sole judgment, may deem necessary to assure
         maintenance of the quality of products sold by Assignor under the
         Trademarks. The foregoing notwithstanding, unless and until an Event of
         Default shall have occurred, Assignee agrees to hold confidential and
         not disclose or use any non-public information regarding any Patent,
         Trademark or License unless such disclosure is required by applicable
         law or court order. This obligation shall survive the termination of
         this Agreement, the release of the security interest herein and such
         reassignment of the Intellectual Property, as applicable, unless such
         termination is due to an Event of Default.

                  8. Release of Security Agreement. Upon the payment and
         performance in full in cash of the Obligations, including the cash
         collateralization, expiration or cancellation of all Obligations, if
         any, consisting of letters of credit, and the full and final
         termination of any commitment to extend any financial accommodations
         under the Credit Agreement, this Security Agreement shall terminate,
         and Assignee shall execute and deliver such documents and instruments
         and take such further action reasonably requested by Assignor, at
         Assignor's expense, as shall be necessary to evidence termination of
         the security interest granted by Assignor to Assignee for the benefit
         of the Assignee and the Bank Product Providers hereunder.

                  9. Intentionally Omitted.

                  10. Duties of Assignor. Assignor shall have the duty to the
         extent commercially reasonable and in Assignor's good faith business
         judgment: (i) to file and prosecute diligently any patent, trademark or
         service mark applications pending as of the date hereof or hereafter
         until all Obligations shall have been paid in full and the Credit
         Agreement has been terminated, (ii) to make application on unpatented
         but patentable inventions and on trademarks and service marks, (iii) to
         preserve and maintain all rights in the Intellectual Property
         (including, but not limited to, with respect to Trademarks, the filing
         of affidavits of use and, incontestability, where applicable, under
         ss.ss.8 and 15 of the Lanham Act (15 U.S.C. ss. 1058, 1065) and
         renewals and, to the extent commercially reasonable, initiating
         opposition or cancellation proceedings or litigation against users of
         the same or confusingly similar marks who seriously threaten the
         validity or rights of Assignor in its Trademarks), and (iv) to ensure
         that the Intellectual Property is and remains enforceable. Any and all
         costs and expenses incurred in connection with Assignor's obligations
         under this Section 10 shall be borne by Assignor. Assignor shall not
         knowingly or unreasonably abandon any right to file a patent, trademark
         or service mark application, or abandon any pending patent application,
         or any other Intellectual Property, without the prior written consent
         of Assignee.

                  11. Assignee's Right to Sue. After an Event of Default,
         Assignee for the benefit of the Assignee and the Bank Product Providers
         shall have the right, but shall in no way be obligated, to bring suit
         in its own name to enforce the Intellectual Property, and, if Assignee
         shall commence any such suit, Assignor shall, at the request of
         Assignee, do any and all lawful acts and execute any and all proper
         documents and instruments reasonably required by Assignee for the
         benefit of the Assignee and the Bank Product Providers in aid of such
         enforcement and Assignor shall promptly, upon demand, reimburse and
         indemnify Assignee for all costs and expenses (including, without
         limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by Assignee (for the
         benefit of the Assignee and the Bank Product Providers) in the exercise
         of its rights under this Section 11.

                  12. Waivers. No course of dealing between Assignor and
         Assignee, nor any failure to exercise, nor any delay in exercising, on
         the part of Assignee, any right, power or privilege hereunder or under
         the Credit Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any
         single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder
         or thereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
         exercise of any other right, power or privilege.

                  13. Severability. The provisions of this Security Agreement
         are severable, and if any clause or provision shall be held invalid and
         unenforceable in whole or in part in any jurisdiction, then such
         invalidity or unenforceability shall affect only such clause or
         provision, or part thereof, in such jurisdiction, and shall not in any
         manner affect such clause or provision in any other jurisdiction, or
         any other clause or provision of this Security Agreement in any
         jurisdiction.

                  14. Modification. This Security Agreement cannot be altered,
         amended or modified in any way, except as specifically provided in
         Section 5 hereof or by a writing signed by the Assignor and the
         Assignee.

                  15. Cumulative Remedies; Power of Attorney; Effect on Credit
         Agreement. All of Assignee's rights and remedies with respect to the
         Intellectual Property (for the benefit of the Assignee and the Bank
         Product Providers), whether established hereby or by the Credit
         Agreement, or by any other agreements or by law shall be cumulative and
         may be exercised singularly or concurrently. Assignor hereby authorizes
         Assignee for the benefit of the Assignee and the Bank Product Providers
         upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, to make, constitute and
         appoint any officer or agent of Assignee as Assignee may select, in its
         sole discretion, as Assignor's true and lawful attorney-in-fact, with
         power to, for the benefit of the Assignee and the Bank Product
         Providers, (i) endorse Assignor's name on all applications, documents,
         papers and instruments necessary or desirable for Assignee in the use
         of the Intellectual Property, or (ii) take any other actions with
         respect to the Intellectual Property as Assignee deems to be in the
         best interest of Assignee, or (iii) grant or issue any exclusive or
         non-exclusive license under the Intellectual Property to any person or
         entity, or (iv) assign, pledge, sell, convey or otherwise transfer
         title in or dispose of any of the Intellectual Property to any person
         or entity. Assignor hereby ratifies all that such attorney shall
         lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue hereof. This power of
         attorney being coupled with an interest shall be irrevocable until all
         Obligations shall have been paid in full and the Credit Agreement has
         been terminated. Assignor acknowledges and agrees that this Security
         Agreement is not intended to limit or restrict in any way the rights
         and remedies of Assignee under the Credit Agreement but rather is
         intended to facilitate the exercise of such rights and remedies.
         Assignee shall have, in addition to all other rights and remedies given
         it by the terms of this Security Agreement and the Credit Agreement,
         all rights and remedies allowed by law, in equity, and the rights and
         remedies of a secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code as
         enacted in New York.

                  16. Indemnification. Assignor hereby agrees to and shall
         defend, indemnify, save, and hold Assignee and the Bank Product
         Providers and each of their respective officers, directors, employees,
         affiliates, and agents harmless from and against: (a) all obligations,
         demands, claims, and liabilities claimed or asserted by any person or
         entity arising out of or relating to this Security Agreement or the
         transactions contemplated hereby, and (b) all costs, expenses, charges,
         penalties, damages, and losses (including, without limitation,
         reasonable attorneys' fees and out-of-pocket costs and expenses) in any
         way suffered, incurred, or paid by Assignee (on behalf of the Assignee
         and/or the Bank Product Providers) as a result of or in any way arising
         out of, following, or consequential to this Security Agreement or the
         transactions contemplated hereby, except for any demands, claims,
         liabilities and losses suffered or incurred by Assignee or any Bank
         Product Provider because of its willful misconduct or gross negligence.
         The indemnification obligations of Assignor provided hereby shall
         survive the termination of this Security Agreement and the Credit
         Agreement.

                  17. Binding Effect; Benefits. This Security Agreement shall be
         binding upon Assignor and its respective successors and assigns, and
         shall inure to the benefit of Assignee, its successors, nominees and
         assigns; provided, however, Assignor shall not assign this Security
         Agreement or any of Assignor's obligations hereunder without the prior
         written consent of Assignee.

                  18. Governing Law. This Security Agreement shall be governed
         by, enforced and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the
         State of New York, without regard to choice of law or conflict of law
         principles.

                  19. Headings; Counterparts. Paragraph headings used herein are
         for convenience only and shall not modify the provisions which they
         precede. This Security Agreement may be signed in one or more
         counterparts, but all of such counterparts shall constitute and be
         deemed to be one and the same instrument. Any fax signature shall be
         deemed to be as legally enforceable and effective as a signed original.

                  20. Further Assurances. Assignor agrees to execute and deliver
         such further agreements, instruments and documents, and to perform such
         further acts, as Assignee shall reasonably request from time to time in
         order to carry out the purpose of this Security Agreement and
         agreements set forth herein. Assignor acknowledges that a copy of this
         Security Agreement will be filed by the Assignee with the United States
         Patent and Trademark Office and, if applicable, the United States
         Copyright Office, at the sole cost and expense of Assignor.

                  21. Intentionally Omitted.

         of any such collateral assignments or documents, the terms "Patents",
         "Copyrights", and "Trademarks" as used herein shall automatically be
         deemed amended to include such foreign patent, copyright and trademark
         registrations and applications without any action required by any
         person or entity.

                  23. VENUE: JURY TRIAL WAIVER. (a) THE PARTIES AGREE THAT ALL

EXHIBIT 10.10

                    INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY SECURITY AGREEMENT

         THIS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY SECURITY AGREEMENT (this "SECURITY
AGREEMENT") dated as of December 9, 2004, is made by EASYLINK SERVICES USA,
INC., a Delaware corporation ("ASSIGNOR"), in favor of WELLS FARGO FOOTHILL,
INC., a California corporation (together with its successors and assigns,
"ASSIGNEE").

                              W I T N E S S E T H:

         WHEREAS, Assignor and certain of its Affiliates (each a "BORROWER" and
collectively, the "BORROWERS") and Assignee are parties to that certain Credit
Agreement of even date herewith (as the same may be amended, supplemented or
modified from time to time, the "CREDIT AGREEMENT"), which provides for Assignee
to make certain loans to Borrowers.

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises set forth herein and
for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, Assignor (intending to be legally bound hereby) agrees
as follows:

                  1. Incorporation of Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement and
         the terms and provisions thereof are hereby incorporated herein in
         their entirety by this reference thereto. All terms capitalized but not
         otherwise defined herein shall have the same meanings herein as in the
         Credit Agreement.

                  2. Security Interest in Intellectual Property. To secure the
         complete satisfaction and payment when due or declared due of all

                  4. Restrictions on Future Agreements. Assignor agrees that
         until all Obligations shall have been satisfied and paid in full and

                  5. New Intellectual Property. Assignor hereby represents and
         warrants to Assignee for the benefit of the Assignee and the Bank
         Product Providers that the Intellectual Property listed on Exhibits A,
         B, C, and D, respectively, constitute all of the Intellectual Property
         material to the Assignor's business and now owned by Assignor. If,
         before all Obligations shall have been satisfied in full or before the
         Credit Agreement has been terminated, Assignor shall (i) become aware
         of any existing Intellectual Property material to the Assignor's
         business of which Assignor has not previously informed Assignee, (ii)
         obtain rights to any new patentable inventions or other Intellectual
         Property material to the Assignor's business, or (iii) become entitled
         to the benefit of any Intellectual Property material to the Assignor's
         business which benefit is not in existence on the date hereof, the
         provisions of this Security Agreement above shall automatically apply
         thereto and Assignor shall give to Assignee prompt written notice
         thereof. Assignor hereby authorizes Assignee to modify this Security
         Agreement by amending Exhibits A, B, C, and D, as applicable, to
         include any such Intellectual Property, and to file or refile this
         Security Agreement with the U.S Patent and Trademark Office and U.S.
         Copyright Office. Assignor agrees to execute and deliver any and all
         documents and instruments necessary or advisable to record or preserve
         Assignee's interest in all Intellectual Property added to Exhibits A,
         B, C, and D pursuant to this Section.

                  6. Royalties; Terms; Rights Upon Default. The term of this
         Security Agreement shall extend until the earlier of (i) the expiration
         of all of the respective Intellectual Property collaterally assigned
         hereunder, and (ii) the indefeasible payment in full of all Obligations
         and the termination of the Credit Agreement. Assignor agrees that upon
         the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, the
         use by Assignee for the benefit of the Assignee and the Bank Product
         Providers of all Intellectual Property shall be worldwide and as
         extensive as the rights of Assignor to use such Intellectual Property,
         and without any liability for royalties or other related charges from
         Assignee or the Bank Product Providers to Assignor. Upon the occurrence
         and during the continuance of any Event of Default, Assignor hereby
         authorizes: (a) the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks, United
         States Patent and Trademark Office (or as appropriate, such equivalent
         agency in foreign countries), to issue any and all Patents to Assignee
         for the benefit of the Assignee and the Bank Product Providers as
         assignee of Assignor's entire interest therein; (b) the Register of
         Copyrights, United States Copyright Office (or as appropriate, such
         equivalent agency in foreign countries), to issue any and all
         certificates of registration or renewal for all of the Copyrights to
         Assignee for the benefit of the Assignee and the Bank Product Providers
         as assignee of Assignor's entire interest therein; and (c) the
         Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks, United States Patent and
         Trademark Office (or as appropriate, such equivalent agency in foreign
         countries) to issue any and all certificates of registration or renewal
         for all of the Trademarks to Assignee for the benefit of the Assignee
         and the Bank Product Providers as assignee of Assignor's entire
         interest therein and in the goodwill of Assignor's business connected
         therewith and symbolized thereby.

                  7. Assignee's Right to Inspect; Trademark Quality Control.
         Assignee shall have the right, at any time and from time to time with
         prior notice (unless an Event of Default has occurred and is
         continuing, in which case prior notice shall not be required) and,
         during normal business hours and prior to payment in full of all
         Obligations and termination of the Credit Agreement, to inspect
         Assignor's premises and to examine Assignor's books, records and
         operations, including, without limitation, Assignor's quality control
         processes. Assignor agrees (i) to maintain the quality of any and all
         products in connection with which the Trademarks are used, consistent
         with the quality of said products as of the date hereof and (ii) to
         provide Assignee, upon Assignee's reasonable request from time to time,
         with a certificate of an officer of Assignor certifying Assignor's
         compliance with the foregoing. Upon the occurrence and during the
         continuance of an Event of Default, Assignor agrees that Assignee, or a
         conservator appointed by Assignee, shall have the right to establish
         such additional product quality controls as Assignee, or said
         conservator, in its sole judgment, may deem necessary to assure
         maintenance of the quality of products sold by Assignor under the
         Trademarks. The foregoing notwithstanding, unless and until an Event of
         Default shall have occurred, Assignee agrees to hold confidential and
         not disclose or use any non-public information regarding any Patent,
         Trademark or License unless such disclosure is required by applicable
         law or court order. This obligation shall survive the termination of
         this Agreement, the release of the security interest herein and such
         reassignment of the Intellectual Property, as applicable, unless such
         termination is due to an Event of Default.

                  8. Release of Security Agreement. Upon the payment and
         performance in full in cash of the Obligations, including the cash
         collateralization, expiration or cancellation of all Obligations, if
         any, consisting of letters of credit, and the full and final
         termination of any commitment to extend any financial accommodations
         under the Credit Agreement, this Security Agreement shall terminate,
         and Assignee shall execute and deliver such documents and instruments
         and take such further action reasonably requested by Assignor, at
         Assignor's expense, as shall be necessary to evidence termination of
         the security interest granted by Assignor to Assignee for the benefit
         of the Assignee and the Bank Product Providers hereunder.

                  9. Intentionally Omitted.

                  10. Duties of Assignor. Assignor shall have the duty to the
         extent commercially reasonable and in Assignor's good faith business
         judgment: (i) to file and prosecute diligently any patent, trademark or
         service mark applications pending as of the date hereof or hereafter
         until all Obligations shall have been paid in full and the Credit
         Agreement has been terminated, (ii) to make application on unpatented
         but patentable inventions and on trademarks and service marks, (iii) to
         preserve and maintain all rights in the Intellectual Property
         (including, but not limited to, with respect to Trademarks, the filing
         of affidavits of use and, incontestability, where applicable, under
         ss.ss.8 and 15 of the Lanham Act (15 U.S.C. ss. 1058, 1065) and
         renewals and, to the extent commercially reasonable, initiating
         opposition or cancellation proceedings or litigation against users of
         the same or confusingly similar marks who seriously threaten the
         validity or rights of Assignor in its Trademarks), and (iv) to ensure
         that the Intellectual Property is and remains enforceable. Any and all
         costs and expenses incurred in connection with Assignor's obligations
         under this Section 10 shall be borne by Assignor. Assignor shall not
         knowingly or unreasonably abandon any right to file a patent, trademark
         or service mark application, or abandon any pending patent application,
         or any other Intellectual Property, without the prior written consent
         of Assignee.

                  11. Assignee's Right to Sue. After an Event of Default,
         Assignee for the benefit of the Assignee and the Bank Product Providers
         shall have the right, but shall in no way be obligated, to bring suit
         in its own name to enforce the Intellectual Property, and, if Assignee
         shall commence any such suit, Assignor shall, at the request of
         Assignee, do any and all lawful acts and execute any and all proper
         documents and instruments reasonably required by Assignee for the
         benefit of the Assignee and the Bank Product Providers in aid of such
         enforcement and Assignor shall promptly, upon demand, reimburse and
         indemnify Assignee for all costs and expenses (including, without
         limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by Assignee (for the
         benefit of the Assignee and the Bank Product Providers) in the exercise
         of its rights under this Section 11.

                  12. Waivers. No course of dealing between Assignor and
         Assignee, nor any failure to exercise, nor any delay in exercising, on
         the part of Assignee, any right, power or privilege hereunder or under
         the Credit Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any
         single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder
         or thereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
         exercise of any other right, power or privilege.

                  13. Severability. The provisions of this Security Agreement
         are severable, and if any clause or provision shall be held invalid and
         unenforceable in whole or in part in any jurisdiction, then such
         invalidity or unenforceability shall affect only such clause or
         provision, or part thereof, in such jurisdiction, and shall not in any
         manner affect such clause or provision in any other jurisdiction, or
         any other clause or provision of this Security Agreement in any
         jurisdiction.

                  14. Modification. This Security Agreement cannot be altered,
         amended or modified in any way, except as specifically provided in
         Section 5 hereof or by a writing signed by the Assignor and the
         Assignee.

                  15. Cumulative Remedies; Power of Attorney; Effect on Credit
         Agreement. All of Assignee's rights and remedies with respect to the
         Intellectual Property (for the benefit of the Assignee and the Bank
         Product Providers), whether established hereby or by the Credit
         Agreement, or by any other agreements or by law shall be cumulative and
         may be exercised singularly or concurrently. Assignor hereby authorizes
         Assignee for the benefit of the Assignee and the Bank Product Providers
         upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, to make, constitute and
         appoint any officer or agent of Assignee as Assignee may select, in its
         sole discretion, as Assignor's true and lawful attorney-in-fact, with
         power to, for the benefit of the Assignee and the Bank Product
         Providers, (i) endorse Assignor's name on all applications, documents,
         papers and instruments necessary or desirable for Assignee in the use
         of the Intellectual Property, or (ii) take any other actions with
         respect to the Intellectual Property as Assignee deems to be in the
         best interest of Assignee, or (iii) grant or issue any exclusive or
         non-exclusive license under the Intellectual Property to any person or
         entity, or (iv) assign, pledge, sell, convey or otherwise transfer
         title in or dispose of any of the Intellectual Property to any person
         or entity. Assignor hereby ratifies all that such attorney shall
         lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue hereof. This power of
         attorney being coupled with an interest shall be irrevocable until all
         Obligations shall have been paid in full and the Credit Agreement has
         been terminated. Assignor acknowledges and agrees that this Security
         Agreement is not intended to limit or restrict in any way the rights
         and remedies of Assignee under the Credit Agreement but rather is
         intended to facilitate the exercise of such rights and remedies.
         Assignee shall have, in addition to all other rights and remedies given
         it by the terms of this Security Agreement and the Credit Agreement,
         all rights and remedies allowed by law, in equity, and the rights and
         remedies of a secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code as
         enacted in New York.

                  16. Indemnification. Assignor hereby agrees to and shall
         defend, indemnify, save, and hold Assignee and the Bank Product
         Providers and each of their respective officers, directors, employees,
         affiliates, and agents harmless from and against: (a) all obligations,
         demands, claims, and liabilities claimed or asserted by any person or
         entity arising out of or relating to this Security Agreement or the
         transactions contemplated hereby, and (b) all costs, expenses, charges,
         penalties, damages, and losses (including, without limitation,
         reasonable attorneys' fees and out-of-pocket costs and expenses) in any
         way suffered, incurred, or paid by Assignee (on behalf of the Assignee
         and/or the Bank Product Providers) as a result of or in any way arising
         out of, following, or consequential to this Security Agreement or the
         transactions contemplated hereby, except for any demands, claims,
         liabilities and losses suffered or incurred by Assignee or any Bank
         Product Provider because of its willful misconduct or gross negligence.
         The indemnification obligations of Assignor provided hereby shall
         survive the termination of this Security Agreement and the Credit
         Agreement.

                  17. Binding Effect; Benefits. This Security Agreement shall be
         binding upon Assignor and its respective successors and assigns, and
         shall inure to the benefit of Assignee, its successors, nominees and
         assigns; provided, however, Assignor shall not assign this Security
         Agreement or any of Assignor's obligations hereunder without the prior
         written consent of Assignee.

                  18. Governing Law. This Security Agreement shall be governed
         by, enforced and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the
         State of New York, without regard to choice of law or conflict of law
         principles.

                  19. Headings; Counterparts. Paragraph headings used herein are
         for convenience only and shall not modify the provisions which they
         precede. This Security Agreement may be signed in one or more
         counterparts, but all of such counterparts shall constitute and be
         deemed to be one and the same instrument. Any fax signature shall be
         deemed to be as legally enforceable and effective as a signed original.

                  20. Further Assurances. Assignor agrees to execute and deliver
         such further agreements, instruments and documents, and to perform such
         further acts, as Assignee shall reasonably request from time to time in
         order to carry out the purpose of this Security Agreement and
         agreements set forth herein. Assignor acknowledges that a copy of this
         Security Agreement will be filed by the Assignee with the United States
         Patent and Trademark Office and, if applicable, the United States
         Copyright Office, at the sole cost and expense of Assignor.

                  21. Intentionally Omitted.

         request of Assignee at any time or from time to time, and at the sole
         cost and expense (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys'

         deliver any and all instruments, agreements, assignments, certificates
         and/or documents, reasonably required by Assignee to collaterally
         assign any and all of Assignor's foreign patent, copyright and
         trademark registrations and applications now owned or hereafter
         acquired to and in favor of Assignee. Upon the execution and delivery
         of any such collateral assignments or documents, the terms "Patents",
         "Copyrights", and "Trademarks" as used herein shall automatically be
         deemed amended to include such foreign patent, copyright and trademark
         registrations and applications without any action required by any
         person or entity.

                  23. VENUE: JURY TRIAL WAIVER. (a) THE PARTIES AGREE THAT ALL
