<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">DALLAS, TX (December&nbsp;22, 2004) &#150; ACIH, Inc. (&#147;ACIH&#148;), a Delaware corporation that will become the

December&nbsp;21, 2004 it priced an offering of $174.0&nbsp;million aggregate principal amount at maturity
($124.9&nbsp;million approximate gross proceeds) of 11&#189;% Senior Discount Notes due 2012. Interest will
accrue on the notes in the form of an increase in the accreted value of the notes prior to December
15, 2007. Thereafter, cash interest on the notes will accrue and be payable semiannually in
arrears, commencing in 2008, at the rate of 11&#189;% per annum. The notes will have an initial accreted
value of $717.91 per $1,000 principal amount at maturity of the notes.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The notes were offered within the United States only to qualified institutional investors pursuant

compliance with Regulation&nbsp;S of the Securities Act.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The net proceeds of the offering will be used to consummate a comprehensive refinancing plan, which
includes, among other things, a cash tender offer and consent solicitation for all of ACI&#146;s
outstanding 10&#189;% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2009 and the repayment of all outstanding borrowings
under ACI&#146;s existing senior secured credit facility.
