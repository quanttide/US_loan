<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><U><B>PAYCHEX, INC. REPORTS RECORD SECOND QUARTER RESULTS</B></U>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">ROCHESTER, NY, December&nbsp;21, 2004 &#151; Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) today announced record net
income of $86.9&nbsp;million, or $.23 diluted earnings per share, for the second quarter ended November
30, 2004, an increase of 8% over net income of $80.7&nbsp;million, or $.21 diluted earnings per share,
for the same period last year. Total revenues were $347.3&nbsp;million, an 11% increase over $312.1
million for the second quarter last year.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">For the six months ended November&nbsp;30, 2004, the Company reported net income of $174.6&nbsp;million, or
$.46 diluted earnings per share, an increase of 8% over net income of $161.0&nbsp;million, or $.42
diluted earnings per share, for the same period last year. Total revenues were $692.3&nbsp;million, an
increase of 11% over $621.4&nbsp;million for the same period last year.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><U><B>SERVICE REVENUES</B></U>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">For the second quarter ended November&nbsp;30, 2004, service revenues, which include the Payroll and
Human Resource and Benefits product lines, were $334.9&nbsp;million, an increase of 13% over $297.6
million for the prior year quarter. For the six months ended November&nbsp;30, 2004, service revenues
were $669.1&nbsp;million, an increase of 13% over $593.5&nbsp;million for the same period last year.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Payroll service revenue increased 9% in the second quarter and 10% in the six-month period to
$278.7&nbsp;million and $559.1&nbsp;million, respectively. Positive year-over-year growth in Payroll
service revenue resulted from organic client base growth, increased utilization of ancillary
services, and price increases. As of November&nbsp;30, 2004, 90% of all clients utilized the Company&#146;s
tax filing and payment services and 64% utilized employee payment services. Major Market Services
revenue increased 28% and 29% for the second quarter and six-month period of fiscal 2005 to $42.5
million and $83.5&nbsp;million, respectively.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Human Resource and Benefits service revenue increased 32% for the second quarter and 31% for the
six-month period of fiscal 2005 to $56.2&nbsp;million and $110.0&nbsp;million, respectively. The increases
reflect growth in clients for Retirement Services, growth in client employees served by the
Company&#146;s comprehensive Paychex Administrative Services (PAS)&nbsp;and Professional Employer
Organization (PEO)&nbsp;bundled services, and the benefit of revenue from the April&nbsp;2004 acquisition of
Stromberg time and attendance products. Retirement Services revenue increased 17% in both the
second quarter and six-month period of fiscal 2005 to $22.5&nbsp;million and $43.4&nbsp;million,
respectively. Administrative fee revenue from PAS and PEO products increased 42% in the second
quarter and 45% in the six-month period of fiscal 2005 to $16.5&nbsp;million and $32.5&nbsp;million,
respectively.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><U><B>INTEREST ON FUNDS HELD FOR CLIENTS</B></U>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Interest on funds held for clients decreased 15% for the second quarter and 17% for the six-month
period of fiscal 2005 to $12.4&nbsp;million and $23.2&nbsp;million, respectively, which was consistent with
the Company&#146;s expectations. The decreases are attributable to lower net realized gains on the sale
of available-for-sale securities, partially offset by higher average interest rates earned and
higher average portfolio balances resulting from client base growth. Average portfolio balances
for both the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2005 were $2.4&nbsp;billion, compared with
$2.3&nbsp;billion in both the respective prior year periods. The average interest rates earned by the
funds held for clients portfolio were 2.0% for the second quarter and 1.9% for the first six months
of fiscal 2005, compared with 1.8% for the respective periods of fiscal 2004. There were no net
realized gains included in interest on funds held for clients for the second quarter of fiscal 2005
and $.2&nbsp;million for the six-month period of fiscal 2005, compared with net realized gains of $4.4
million and $7.1&nbsp;million for the respective prior year periods.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><U><B>CONSOLIDATED EXPENSES AND OPERATING INCOME</B></U>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Consolidated operating, selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 12% in both the
second quarter and six-month period of fiscal 2005 over the prior year periods. The increases are
due to increases in personnel, information technology, and other costs to support the organic
growth of the Company. Higher professional services expenses related to pending legal matters also
contributed to the increases in consolidated expenses for both the second quarter and six-month
period.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Operating income increased 11% in both the second quarter and six-month period to $126.9&nbsp;million
and $255.6&nbsp;million, respectively. Operating income growth continues to be impacted by fluctuations
in interest rates earned and realized gain comparisons in the funds held for clients investment
portfolio. Operating income (excluding interest on funds held for clients) increased 14% and 15%
year-over-year in the second quarter and six-month period to $114.5&nbsp;million and $232.4&nbsp;million,
respectively. Operating income (excluding interest on funds held for clients) as a percentage of
total service revenues was 34% for the second quarter and 35% for the first six months of fiscal
2005, compared with 34% for both the respective prior year periods.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><U><B>INVESTMENT INCOME, NET</B></U>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Investment income, net decreased 46% for the second quarter and 44% for the six-month period to
$2.8&nbsp;million and $5.0&nbsp;million, respectively, which was consistent with the Company&#146;s expectations.
The decreases are due to lower net realized gains on the sale of available-for-sale securities and
lower average interest rates earned, offset somewhat by higher average portfolio balances. Average
portfolio balances for the corporate investment portfolio were approximately $557&nbsp;million and $544
million for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2005, compared with average balances
of $415&nbsp;million and $400&nbsp;million in the respective prior year periods. The average interest rates
earned for the corporate investment portfolio were 2.0% for the second quarter and 1.9% for the
first six months of fiscal 2005, compared with 2.5% and 2.7% in the respective prior year periods.
There were no net realized gains included in investment income in the second quarter or six-month
period of fiscal 2005, compared with $2.7&nbsp;million and $4.2&nbsp;million in the respective prior year
periods.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><U><B>INCOME TAXES</B></U>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The effective income tax rates were 33.0% for both the second quarter and six-month period of
fiscal 2005, compared with 32.7% and 32.6% for the respective prior year periods.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Jonathan J. Judge, president and chief executive officer of Paychex, said, &#147;We are pleased with our
financial results for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2005, which were in line
with our expectations. We remain focused on growing our client base, increasing utilization of our
ancillary services, and improving our profit margins. Estimated total revenue growth for fiscal
2005 is expected to be in the range of 9% to 11%, accompanied by net income growth in the range of
16% to 18%. In addition, we expect that growth in operating income, excluding interest on funds
held for clients, expense charges in fiscal 2004 for pending legal matters, and the net incremental
PEO revenue benefit recognized in fiscal 2004, will approximate 15%. These expectations are
based on current economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes.&#148;

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Certain written and oral statements made by Paychex, Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;) management may constitute
&#147;forward-looking statements&#148; as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
Forward-looking statements are identified by such words and phrases as &#147;we expect,&#148; &#147;expected to,&#148;
&#147;estimates,&#148; &#147;current outlook,&#148; &#147;we look forward to,&#148; &#147;would equate to,&#148; &#147;projects,&#148; &#147;projections,&#148;
&#147;projected to be,&#148; &#147;anticipates,&#148; &#147;anticipated,&#148; &#147;we believe,&#148; &#147;could be,&#148; and other similar
phrases. All statements addressing operating performance, events, or developments that the Company
expects or anticipates will occur in the future, including statements relating to revenue growth,
earnings, earnings-per-share growth, or similar projections, are forward-looking statements within
the meaning of the Reform Act. Because they are forward-looking, they should be evaluated in light
of important risk factors. These risk factors include, but are not limited to, the following or
those which are described in the Company&#146;s SEC filings, including the most recent Form 10-K:
general market and economic conditions, including demand for the Company&#146;s products and services,
competition, price levels, availability of internal and external resources, effective execution of
expansion plans, and effective integration of acquisitions; changes in the laws regulating
collection and payment of payroll taxes, professional employer organizations, and employee
benefits, including 401(k) plans, workers&#146; compensation, state unemployment, and section 125 plans;
delays in the development, timing of the introduction, and marketing of new products and services;
changes in technology, including use of the Internet; the possibility of catastrophic events that
could impact the Company&#146;s operating facilities, computer systems, and communication systems; the
possibility of third-party service providers failing to perform their functions; the possibility of
penalties and losses resulting from errors and omissions in performing services; the possibility
that internal control weaknesses may be identified during control reviews; potential unfavorable
outcomes related to pending legal matters; potential damage to the Company&#146;s business reputation
due to these and other operational risks; the possible inability of clients to meet payroll
obligations; stock volatility; and changes in short- and long-term interest rates, changes in the
market value of available-for-sale securities, and the credit rating of cash, cash equivalents, and
securities held in the Company&#146;s investment portfolios, all of which could cause actual results to
differ materially from anticipated results. The information provided in this document is based
upon the facts and circumstances known at this time.
