option, of up to $100 million, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. The revolving credit facility expires on December 31, 2009. The outstanding principal amount of term loan B borrowings will be repayable as follows: (a) an aggregate
of $2.2 million per annum payable in four equal quarterly installments for each of the first five years and (b) in the sixth year, an aggregate of $209 million payable in four equal quarterly installments with the final quarterly payment payable

favorably than) the term loan B facility (including with respect to mandatory and voluntary prepayments and collateral and guarantee position); provided that the Incremental Facilities may provide for material additional or different financial or
other covenants applicable only during periods after the final maturity of the term loan B facility. Borrowings under the Incremental Facilities will bear interest at a rate per annum that will not exceed the interest rate per annum on term loan B
facility borrowings by more than 0.25% unless the interest rate on term loan B borrowings is concurrently increased to be no less than 0.25% less than the interest rate on borrowings under the Incremental Facilities. In order to request the

indebtedness with the New Loan Agreement collateral. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"
