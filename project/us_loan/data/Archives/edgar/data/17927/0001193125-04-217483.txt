of $2.2 million per annum payable in four equal quarterly installments for each of the first five years and (b) in the sixth year, an aggregate of $209 million payable in four equal quarterly installments with the final quarterly payment payable

facility borrowings by more than 0.25% unless the interest rate on term loan B borrowings is concurrently increased to be no less than 0.25% less than the interest rate on borrowings under the Incremental Facilities. In order to request the

the parties to apply the usury laws of the State of New York). Accordingly, the provisions of this <U>Section 11.7</U> shall govern and control over every other provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document which conflicts or is
inconsistent with this Section, even if such provision declares that it controls. As used in this Section, the term &#147;interest&#148; includes the aggregate of all charges, fees, benefits or other compensation which constitute interest under
applicable law, <U>provided</U> that, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, (a) any non-principal payment shall be characterized as an expense or as compensation for something other than the use, forbearance or detention of money and
not as interest, and (b) all interest at any time contracted for, reserved, charged or received shall be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread, in equal parts during the full term of the Obligations. In no event shall Borrower or any other

(if any) of the United States or of any other jurisdiction, or (b) total interest in excess of the amount which such Lender could lawfully have contracted for, reserved, received, retained or charged had the interest been calculated for the full
term of the Obligations at the Ceiling Rate. The daily interest rates to be used in calculating interest at the Ceiling Rate shall be determined by dividing the applicable Ceiling Rate per annum by the number of days in the calendar year for which
such calculation is being made. None of the terms and provisions contained in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document (including, without limitation, <U>Section 9.1</U> hereof) which directly or indirectly relate to interest shall ever be
construed without reference to this <U>Section 11.7</U>, or be construed to create a contract to pay for the use, forbearance or detention of money at an interest rate in excess of the Ceiling Rate. If the term of any Obligation is shortened by
reason of acceleration of maturity as a result of any Default or by any other cause, or by reason of any required or permitted prepayment, and if for that (or any other) reason any Lender at any time, including but not limited to, the stated
maturity, is owed or receives (and/or has received) interest in excess of interest calculated at the Ceiling Rate, then and in any such event all of any such excess interest shall be canceled automatically as of the date of such acceleration,
prepayment or other event which produces the excess, and, if such excess interest has been paid to such Lender, it shall be credited <U>pro tanto</U> against the then-outstanding principal balance of Borrower&#146;s obligations to such Lender,
effective as of the date or dates when the event occurs which causes it to be excess interest, until such excess is exhausted or all of such principal has been fully paid and satisfied, whichever occurs first, and any remaining balance of such

basis with Carrols Holdings. Carrols Holdings has determined that it should have requested permission from the Internal Revenue Service (the &#147;IRS&#148;) in order for Carrols Holdings and its Subsidiaries to file consolidated federal income tax
returns for certain prior taxable years. Accordingly, Carrols Holdings will file a ruling request with the IRS requesting such permission. If such request is denied, Borrower believes that Borrower could still properly have filed a consolidated
return with the Taco Cabana Subsidiaries and the Pollo Subsidiaries, but this result is uncertain. If the IRS were to successfully challenge the inclusion of those Subsidiaries in Borrower&#146;s consolidated tax return, Borrower estimates that it
would owe back taxes in an aggregate amount ranging from approximately $5 million to approximately $15 million plus interest (tax-effected) ranging from approximately $1 million to approximately $3 million. In such event, Borrower would have net
operating loss carryforwards that could be utilized to offset future taxable income of the Borrower, and only the interest would negatively impact Borrower&#146;s earnings. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT
