<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Project" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>On December 22, 2004, Amici Ventures,
Inc. (&#147;<B>AMICI</B>&#148;) and Sibling Entertainment, Inc. (&#147;Sibling&#148;)
entered into a non binding letter of intent (the &#147;Letter of Intent&#148;) intended to
summarize the principal terms of a proposal being considered by AMICI regarding its
possible acquisition (the &#147;possible Acquisition&#148;) of all of the outstanding
capital stock of Sibling either through the merger of Sibling with and into a wholly-owned
subsidiary of AMICI or through a direct share exchange agreement among AMICI and the
shareholders of Sibling (collectively, the &#147;<B>Sibling Shareholders</B>&#148;). The
Letter of Intent merely constitutes a statement of the Parties&#146; mutual intentions
with respect to the Possible Acquisition and does not contain all matters upon which
agreement must be reached in order for the transaction to be consummated and, therefore,
does not constitute a binding commitment with respect to the Possible Acquisition. A
binding commitment to the Possible Acquisition will result only from the execution,
delivery and consummation of a definitive agreement (the &#147;Definitive
Agreement&#148;), subject to the conditions expressed in the Letter of Intent. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Project" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The letter of intent is subject to
numerous conditions, including satisfactory completion of due diligence, finalization of
the terms of the combination and structure of the transaction; negotiation, preparation
and execution of definitive transaction documents, compliance with state and federal
securities laws and regulations, and corporate, shareholder and regulatory approvals. The
Letter of Intent terminates automatically if a Definitive Agreement is not executed by
March 31, 2004. The binding provisions of the Letter of Intent shall survive any such
termination. If a final agreement is reached and the other conditions satisfied, the
transaction is expected to close no later than the third calendar quarter of 2005.
However, as a result of the foregoing uncertainties, there can be no assurances that the
transaction will be completed. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Project" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Both AMICI. and Sibling are based and
operating in New York, New York in offices leased by Sibling Entertainment, Inc. Both
companies pursue similar operations including the purchase and exploitation of literary
rights for the production of both film and stage properties; management consulting
agreements with theatrical production companies and film production companies, consulting
agreements for the management of theatrical real estate. Both companies seek similar
direct arrangements with authors, production companies, theatres as well as the formation
of new companies to finance, produce productions for stage and film, and may also seek the
direct acquisition of companies that currently possess rights or agreements desired by the
Company. </FONT></P>
