         original issuance.

   X   - Designates that the above rating agency did not rate any classes in this transaction at the time of

 rating agency, no request has been made subsequent to issuance to obtain rating
 information, if any, from such rating agency. The current ratings were obtained
 directly from the applicable rating agency within 30 days of the payment date
 listed above. The ratings may have changed since they were obtained. Because the
 ratings may have changed, you may want to obtain current ratings directly from the
